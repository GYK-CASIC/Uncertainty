Freddy vs. The Fuzz At 12:30am Friday morning, local police dispatch received a panicked phone call from a security guard at Freddy Fazzbear's Pizzeria. The guard was stammering, obviously fearing for his life, claiming that the animatronic characters that are the hallmark attractions of the establishment were out to kill him, that the company had deliberately restricted his power so that he would die, and how he had no means to defend himself. Knowing that the establishment was frugal with power almost to a fault, and that said power was restricted by an automatic breaker device, it was decided to send in a SWAT team to help resolve the situation. While the SWAT team was en route, members of the electrical company disabled the automatic breaker, giving the poor soul unlimited power. After informing dispatch that the lights were on and the doors to the security",

He tries to make his escape by lashing his staff with a machete and running away, but one of the guards tackles Freddy and grabs him on the way. However, one of the customers, one of the security guards, shoots him twice in the abdomen. Freddy falls to the ground and becomes unconscious, and when the door slams shut, he is stuck there, unable to get up, and thus falls victim to his own incompetence and his victims'. He is dragged away by the cops from the restaurant, and later carried back to the police department.\n\nThe incident happened on the evening of October 26, 1995 at the pizza restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida"
