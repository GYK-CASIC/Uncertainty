Casey had his heart first broken at the age of five, when his horseshoe-haired father came home from Friday happy hour stinking of rye whiskey and lashed a belt around his wrist. He let the buckle free, though, and cracked it over Casey's back like a whip. That was Casey's first memory of speaking, when he screamed \"no, no, no,\" and his father ignored that. And yet it was his father who broke his heart again, when Casey was eleven, moving out of the house finally and turning Casey's mother into a single mother. Casey never saw his father after that,",

Casey had his heart first broken at the age of five, when he was forced to move from his hometown in Northern California to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere, Kansas. He's never forgotten that pain, and he's determined to protect his heart from ever being broken again. He's spent the last ten years of his life traveling the world, never putting down roots, never staying in one place for more than a few months at a time. He's seen the world, and he's done a lot of living, but he's never truly felt alive. Until he meets her."

When I woke up the next morning and rolled over to look at my wife, I saw a number above her head. It was 1. I looked at my head and it said 2. I thought, \"What does it mean? Is it the number of people I'm going to kill today?\" I got up and went to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and saw the number 3 above my head. I thought, \"Oh no, I'm not going to kill anyone today. I'm going to kill three people!\" I went downstairs to the kitchen and saw my wife making breakfast. I said, \"Honey, I'm not going to kill anyone today. I'm going to kill three people!\" She said, \"That's nice, dear. I'm going to kill four people today.\" I said, \"What? You're going to kill four people"

They were a hardy and adaptable race that had been waging war on themselves for millennia. They entertained themselves with battle so it was a perfect fit. The other races were not informed by the Eldar Council of this decision. The tenuous peace pacts had to be preserved but they felt this security force would handle the unrest well. The Eldar Race offered humanity technology and knowledge that would save their world and expand their minds. They adapted well with these new tools.
