In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetricsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we exploredifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory andthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derivethe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theoryand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In thesecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverseprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover backthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples ofinterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simplecosmological model.",
    "ai_generated_text": "A somewhat unconventional quantum formulation of the canonical commutation relations in quantum mechanical systems—known as the polymer representation—has attracted growing interest in recent years, owing to its conceptual and mathematical links to loop quantum gravity and other background-independent frameworks. In this approach, the Hilbert space is constructed in a manner that explicitly breaks the weak continuity of translation operators, giving rise to a discrete structure in either configuration or momentum space. This representation diverges from the standard Schrödinger framework, leading to altered spectral properties of fundamental observables and a distinctive notion of dynamics. We present a systematic examination of the polymer quantization scheme for simple mechanical systems, with particular attention to the harmonic oscillator and the free particle, and analyze how the inherent discretization scale shapes measurable quantities. The study includes a detailed comparison with conventional quantization, emphasizing differences in energy spectra, eigenstates, and semiclassical behavior. We also discuss potential physical implications, particularly in scenarios where minimal length scales are anticipated from quantum gravitational considerations. Our findings indicate that polymer quantization serves as a valuable testing ground for probing deviations from standard quantum mechanics, while preserving mathematical rigor and offering insights into possible phenomenological signatures of quantum geometry."

We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extendsdown to at least a few x.001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's fromextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's aremore highly clustered than the later stages and that the backgroundextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation functionas seen in other extra-galactic studies.

The spatial arrangement of these categories shows a pronounced clustering of the youngest sources within dense molecular cores, pointing to active, localized star formation. Mid-infrared color indices and flux ratios allow us to constrain disk properties and trace evolutionary patterns, while comparisons with millimeter and extinction maps reveal correlations between stellar age and ambient cloud density.

These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s.

Evidencefor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya ispresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta andhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at theouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow ofmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) andclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with theaccretion curtain model.",

The findings clearly indicate accretion onto magnetic poles via a truncated disk, with line broadening and Doppler shifts pointing to contributions from both magnetically guided accretion curtains and the inner disk regions. Comparing the two epochs reveals subtle yet meaningful differences in velocity structure and the relative strengths of high-excitation lines, hinting at long-term changes in accretion geometry or mass transfer rate. Radial velocity measurements of the Balmer and He II lines constrain the binary’s orbital parameters and refine the white dwarf’s mass estimate. Phase-resolved spectroscopy supports a scenario in which optical emission is primarily driven by reprocessing in the accretion curtains, supplemented by emission from the heated white dwarf surface.

Computations carried outwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlssonand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive todynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to lookfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggeststhat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided byALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the coolgas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models ofthe solar atmosphere.

Our research targets the spatial and temporal variability of fine-scale features such as fibrils, spicules, and magnetic bright points, aiming to pinpoint the primary physical processes that drive energy transfer from the photosphere to the corona. Through inversion techniques applied to multi-wavelength datasets, we extract temperature, density, and velocity profiles across distinct layers, enabling direct comparisons with synthetic observables generated by 3D MHD models. The findings provide compelling evidence for intermittent heating caused by magneto-acoustic shocks and magnetic reconnection, along with anisotropic wave energy dissipation shaped by the local magnetic topology. These results indicate that chromospheric dynamics arise from a complex interplay between magnetic and fluid processes, carrying significant implications for solar atmospheric modeling and space weather forecasting.

We introduce and analyze globally defined geometric structures that emerge from imposing additional curvature or torsion constraints on a Finsler metric, with particular attention to their behavior under smooth transformations and various connections. Our framework bridges local differential geometric properties with global topological aspects, enabling a systematic classification of special Finsler manifolds through invariants derived from the Chern and Berwald connections. We establish precise conditions under which these manifolds admit parallelizable structures and explore the relationships among flag curvature, Ricci tensors, and holonomy groups in this setting. In addition, we present several novel examples demonstrating how global properties—such as completeness, compactness, or symmetry—shape the existence and uniqueness of special Finsler metrics. By integrating analytic methods with geometric topology, we extend existing results on homogeneous Finsler spaces and offer fresh perspectives on their moduli. The paper concludes with applications to geodesic flows, stability in variational problems, and potential connections to generalized gravity theories, underscoring the wider mathematical and physical significance of special Finsler manifolds."

Bader charge analysis and projected density of states reveal substantial electron donation from potassium’s 4s orbitals into the graphite π‑system, imparting metallic behavior and altering the Fermi surface. Computed formation energies demonstrate the thermodynamic stability of stage‑I intercalation compounds across various compositions.

Phonon calculations suggest potassium incorporation softens specific out‑of‑plane vibrational modes, with possible effects on thermal conductivity. The balance between ionic and covalent bonding contributions is discussed in relation to intercalation energetics and charge transport.

Off-shell closure of the symmetry algebra is achieved through auxiliary fields, guaranteeing exact nilpotency independent of the equations of motion. Conversely, the on-shell form arises naturally when auxiliary fields are removed, yielding closure only under dynamical constraints. The method is illustrated for Abelian and non-Abelian gauge models, where gauge-invariant Lagrangian densities emerge directly from the superfield construction, and the corresponding conserved BRST charges follow from Noether’s theorem. Interpreting BRST and anti-BRST transformations as superspace shifts elucidates their mutual anticommutativity and the role of Curci–Ferrari-type conditions in non-Abelian settings.

We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

Clusters with higher ρ_h typically show a greater turnover mass, indicating more effective retention of low-mass stars and reduced tidal stripping. In contrast, low-ρ_h clusters exhibit a turnover shifted toward lower masses, pointing to heightened vulnerability to external tidal forces and internal two-body relaxation. These patterns are captured by straightforward analytic models in which the initial mass function evolves under dissolution timescales that decrease with increasing ρ_h.

This sector is dictated purely by the kinematic characteristics of the pp-wave geometry — particularly its null Killing vector and plane-fronted gravitational wave profile — and appears across a broad range of covariant models, including gauge theories, gravity, and certain higher-spin systems. We trace the origin of this universality to the decomposition of field fluctuations into modes aligned with pp-wave symmetries, demonstrating that the effective equations for a subset of these modes simplify to those of free fields in flat space with a modified light-cone metric. The universality property ensures that scattering amplitudes, conserved currents, and certain correlation functions within this sector remain unchanged under deformations of the parent theory, as long as the background retains its pp-wave structure.

Experiments revealed clear spectral patterns, with sharp narrowband peaks layered over a broad background—evidence of the interplay between localized resonances and collective scattering modes. Energy measurements showed a nonlinear link between emission intensity and input power, reflecting threshold behavior typical of multi-photon excitation. Temporal data, captured using high-speed photodetection and time-correlated single-photon counting, displayed sub-nanosecond rise times followed by multi-exponential decay, indicating the presence of both rapid radiative channels and slower energy relaxation processes. Interpretation within a coupled-mode theoretical framework incorporates near-field interactions between spheres and changes in the local optical density of states. Potential applications range from highly directional light sources and photonic sensors to platforms for exploring light–matter interactions at mesoscopic scales. These results offer fresh insight into the controlled generation of structured optical emissions, paving the way for engineered photonic devices harnessing the photonic flame effect."

It is derived directly from thekernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. Theproposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisychaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predicta future value of chaotic time series from the present one.

The method incorporates finite sample effects, measurement uncertainties, and possible correlations among variables. We outline the theoretical foundations for selecting optimal kernel bandwidths, balancing bias and variance to achieve accurate approximations of true probability densities. The approach is demonstrated through case studies in both classical and quantum experiments, where the resulting density functions are used to identify functional relationships between observables. Our findings show that kernel-based statistical modeling delivers robust, interpretable reconstructions of empirical laws, even in conditions with sparse or heterogeneous data. Moreover, the methodology extends naturally to multivariate cases, supporting the discovery of coupled dependencies among physical quantities.

Our focus is on the effects of quark–quark and quark–antiquark double scattering, which generate medium-induced correlations and reshape the probability distributions governing parton fragmentation. Employing generalized factorization for twist-four matrix elements, we derive medium-modified fragmentation functions and assess their dependence on nuclear size, parton flavor, and kinematic conditions.

Numerical evaluations using model-based nuclear quark distributions show that double scattering can either suppress or enhance hadron yields compared to the vacuum baseline, depending on the balance between energy loss and parton recombination.

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spina=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbitswhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respectto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact oppositeto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

Traditional radiative transfer methods, though precise, are computationally expensive, limiting their use for large observational datasets. In this study, we introduce a streamlined modeling framework that merges accelerated non-LTE radiative transfer calculations with robust statistical inference, allowing rapid analysis of complex spectral-line data from star-forming regions, molecular clouds, and circumstellar disks. The method integrates precomputed grids of physical conditions with machine-learning-based emulators to predict emergent spectra, cutting computational costs without compromising accuracy. We apply this approach to multi-transition CO and HCN observations from the ALMA and SOFIA archives, obtaining parameter estimates consistent with full radiative transfer models but at a fraction of the computational time. Sensitivity tests confirm the method’s resilience to observational noise and calibration uncertainties. This framework lays the groundwork for efficiently leveraging upcoming large-scale surveys, providing a powerful tool to translate high-quality spectral measurements into detailed physical and chemical insights into the interstellar medium."

The redundancy is expressed by theentropy of information pertaining to the probability density function ofexperimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due tointegration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancyis derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data aboutthese variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation ofthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information andinformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity ofthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experimentsneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the costfunction. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics isdemonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.",
    "ai_generated_text": "Redundancy in experimental data serves as a fundamental statistic from which the complexity of a natural phenomenon—and the optimal number of experiments needed to study it—can be deduced and refined. In empirical research, redundancy occurs when multiple measurements provide overlapping insights into the system under investigation. Although often viewed as inefficient, redundancy can illuminate aspects of system complexity, measurement reliability, and the adequacy of sampling strategies. Here, we introduce a formal framework that links data redundancy to the intrinsic dimensionality of the phenomenon, enabling a quantitative evaluation of how many truly independent observations are necessary to reach a desired level of predictive accuracy. Our method uses entropy-based metrics to separate genuine variability from repeated information, thereby guiding experimental design toward reducing needless duplication while maintaining statistical robustness. Applications to both simulated and real-world datasets show that redundancy analysis can uncover latent structures, reveal hidden correlations, and guard against overfitting in model development. This approach provides a rigorous blueprint for striking a balance between thoroughness and efficiency in experimental science, with relevance across disciplines—from physics and biology to social sciences and engineering—where data collection is costly or invasive."

Findings indicate that rising temperatures lead to notable decreases in Young’s modulus and tensile strength, driven mainly by intensified atomic vibrations and weakened van der Waals coupling between layers.

At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January),X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\\rm X}$ $\\sim$ 2.4 $\\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergss$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-componentplane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV.

Here, we review over two decades of its X-ray evolution, emphasizing spatially resolved spectroscopy and imaging that have traced the interplay between the expanding blast wave and the intricate circumstellar environment. Our data capture the transition from the initial rapid brightening—triggered as the shock front struck the dense equatorial ring—to a more recent stage marked by morphological transformations and spectral softening, signaling cooling post-shock gas and shifting shock dynamics. High-resolution images reveal asymmetries shaped by the ring’s uneven density distribution and potentially by reverse shocks moving into the ejecta. Spectral analyses chart the shift from largely non-equilibrium ionization toward conditions approaching collisional ionization equilibrium, with elemental abundances indicative of processed stellar material. This long-term record constrains shock velocities, density variations, and particle acceleration efficiency. We explore how these X-ray insights complement multi-wavelength observations, together offering a unified view of the remnant’s hydrodynamic and radiative evolution. Ongoing monitoring of SN 1987A provides a rare opportunity to study supernova remnant formation in real time, bridging the gap between core-collapse explosions and their mature counterparts."

Here we analyze the performance ofRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selectedfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributedentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examplesshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is onlyslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matchedfilter can require significantly more feedback.",

We present a unified framework that captures feedback quantization, delay, and estimation errors, and assess how these imperfections diminish achievable rates relative to the ideal full-CSI scenario. Our approach integrates stochastic channel modeling with optimization methods to design robust precoding matrices that maximize expected mutual information under realistic constraints. Simulations show that even coarse feedback quantization can deliver substantial gains over open-loop transmission when the precoder is engineered to accommodate feedback uncertainty. In addition, we derive closed-form expressions for rate loss as a function of feedback resolution and delay, providing clear insights into system design trade-offs.

The wavelength intervalexplored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration timerender our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different statesof the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described inthe literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in theH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in theV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contraryto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights ofNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variabilityepisode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flarewith t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.",
    "ai_generated_text": "Spectral variability serves as a key diagnostic for constraining emission models of BL Lac objects. Through systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS2, we examine the temporal and spectral evolution of its broadband output across multiple epochs. Coordinated optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray monitoring enables us to quantify flux fluctuations and shifts in spectral slope over timescales from hours to months. The data reveal strong correlations between high-energy spectral hardening and elevated flux states, consistent with particle acceleration episodes within a relativistic jet. We apply a time-dependent synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model to interpret the observed variability, accounting for changes in the electron energy distribution and magnetic field strength. Our findings indicate that rapid spectral transitions are most accurately explained by localized shock fronts moving downstream in the jet, whereas longer-term patterns point to gradual evolution in the physical properties of the emitting region. This work emphasizes the importance of multiwavelength campaigns in disentangling competing emission scenarios and solidifies PKS2’s status as a benchmark source for variability-based constraints. The results shed new light on the interplay between particle acceleration, radiative cooling, and jet dynamics in BL Lac objects, paving the way for more refined characterization of blazar emission processes."

Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates ina spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on theother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b.

We find that the overall binary fraction of acluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at latetimes when a cluster is near dissolution.

By removing reliance on predefined seeds and exhaustively scanning for all possible stable cone configurations, our approach guarantees infrared and collinear safety to all orders in perturbation theory. We benchmark this method against traditional iterative cone algorithms using simulated proton–proton collisions at LHC energies, assessing jet energy resolution, resilience under pile‑up conditions, and reconstruction efficiency in complex multi‑jet environments.

By mapping multivariate predictors onto a single latent index and applying a nonparametric link function, this method alleviates the curse of dimensionality and captures complex nonlinear relationships without relying on restrictive parametric assumptions. This paper revisits the theoretical foundations of the single-index framework, focusing on recent progress in estimation strategies, asymptotic analysis, and robustness under model misspecification. We introduce a unified methodology that combines penalized estimation of index parameters with adaptive smoothing for the link function, enabling scalable computation and automatic control of model complexity. Simulation experiments show the approach’s robustness to noise, multicollinearity, and heteroscedasticity, consistently outperforming traditional linear and additive models in predictive accuracy. Applications to real-world economic and biomedical data demonstrate how the model delivers interpretable projections while revealing nonlinear effects that standard regression often overlooks. These results underscore the continued importance of the single-index model as a concise yet powerful tool for contemporary data analysis, effectively connecting statistical theory with practical solutions in complex, high-dimensional contexts."

ALMA continuum and CO line imaging resolve disk structures around young binaries with separations under 1 AU, revealing asymmetric inner rims and filamentary features indicative of accretion streams. Hydrodynamic models incorporating orbital dynamics, disk viscosity, and pressure gradients replicate these morphologies and predict episodic accretion bursts tied to the binary’s orbital phase.

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the directmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, forboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes itstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-typegalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass functionwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxysample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, andintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the localmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-typegalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}.

Isospin-dependent alterations to the pion self-energy produce marked softening or hardening of the modes, with charged pions showing heightened sensitivity to the proton fraction. At high asymmetry, the splitting becomes significant, potentially shifting thresholds for pion condensation and affecting transport properties. We analyze the interplay between short-range nuclear correlations and long-range pion exchange, revealing a complex density dependence of the pion effective mass that is closely linked to the symmetry energy slope parameter. Our results yield quantitative predictions for pion spectral functions in ANM, providing a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental signatures such as differential pion yields and collective flow asymmetries in isospin-rich systems.

Local nano-frictionexperiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine theevolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure forthe different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressurein the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent frictioncoefficient is high ($\\mu$ > 0.4).

    "ai_generated_text": "The layered structure and rheological characteristics of anti-wear films, formed in rolling/sliding contacts from lubricants containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), were examined using advanced surface characterization and nano-mechanical testing methods. These tribofilms, generated under boundary lubrication, display a tiered architecture with an amorphous, phosphate-rich outer layer over a crystalline, zinc-rich interlayer bonded to the steel substrate. Focused ion beam cross-sectioning combined with transmission electron microscopy revealed that layer thickness varies with contact load and sliding speed. Nanoindentation tests showed the films exhibit viscoelastic behavior, with modulus and hardness strongly affected by strain rate and temperature, indicating an ability to dissipate mechanical energy during service. Rheological measurements under controlled shear demonstrated a shift from elastic-dominated to viscous-dominated responses at critical stress levels, aligning with changes in wear protection performance. These results support a mechanistic model in which ZDDP-derived tribofilms adjust their mechanical properties to changing contact conditions, thereby improving durability and minimizing material loss. This work offers fresh insight into the relationship between microstructural evolution and functional performance of anti-wear films, informing the development of next-generation lubricant additives for high-performance mechanical systems."

In principle infinite solutions exist to thisproblem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet importantrequirements.

We conduct a systematic examination of how different discretization schemes and relaxation models affect macroscopic quantities such as velocity and pressure fields in both incompressible and weakly compressible regimes. Particular emphasis is placed on boundary treatment techniques, including bounce-back and interpolation-based methods, and their influence on accuracy in simulations involving curved or moving boundaries. By combining benchmark tests with theoretical analysis, we pinpoint conditions under which LB simulations remain resilient to numerical instabilities, especially at high Reynolds numbers.

The formulation accounts for both phonon emission and absorption processes arising from the coupling between the atom and quantized vibrational modes of the substrate, and remains valid for any level configuration and temperature. Using a perturbative treatment of the atom–phonon interaction within the Born–Markov framework, we determine transition rates that explicitly depend on the phonon spectral density and the spatial overlap of atomic wavefunctions in the surface potential. The resulting master equation captures both relaxation toward thermal equilibrium and dephasing between translational states. We demonstrate the method for typical van der Waals and Casimir–Polder surface potentials, calculating level lifetimes and energy shifts for representative atomic species.

The interpretation depends critically on precise determinations of tangential velocities and cooling sequences derived from models, both of which affect inferred ages and population assignments. Here, we synthesize recent findings, incorporating updated Gaia astrometry, improved photometric parallax calibrations, and revised atmospheric models. Our results show that while some candidates exhibit velocities and metallicities indicative of halo membership, most align more closely with the dynamics of an older thick disk population. This reclassification lowers estimates of the local halo white dwarf density and calls into question earlier claims that they represent a significant dark matter component. We examine the methodological sensitivities that shape these conclusions and propose priorities for upcoming surveys aimed at better constraining the faint end of the halo white dwarf luminosity function."

In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such lowT/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in thenonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, whichshow that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside thecorotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-modedeformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation areconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays animportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainableamplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.",

Employing models with steep angular velocity gradients, we measure the onset and nonlinear evolution of the bar-mode, tracking its growth rate, saturation amplitude, and subsequent behavior. Our results show that strong differential rotation markedly lowers the effective instability threshold, triggering swift bar formation on dynamical timescales. The ensuing non-axisymmetric structures endure for many rotation periods, driving efficient gravitational wave emission and redistributing angular momentum. We also examine how instability varies with the degree of differential rotation, identifying a shift from short-lived bar-like oscillations to persistent triaxial configurations. These findings carry important implications for the evolution of newborn neutron stars, merger remnants, and other astrophysical systems where differential rotation is prevalent, highlighting the need to update stability criteria beyond the assumption of uniform rotation."

The governing wave equation for the torsional mode is solved analytically for idealized density profiles and numerically for more realistic distributions derived from coronal observations. Our findings show that longitudinal density gradients cause pronounced deviations from the uniform-frequency behavior expected in homogeneous tubes: the oscillation spectrum splits into discrete modes, with frequency shifts determined by both the magnitude and spatial scale of the inhomogeneity. The wave patterns display asymmetric node placement and amplitude modulation, with energy tending to concentrate in low-density regions. These results indicate that torsional Alfvén seismology offers a sensitive means of probing longitudinal density structure in coronal loops, potentially constraining heating and mass transport processes.

The three flames havebeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentrationprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after samplingwith a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide anddioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using aPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in ourlaboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The mainreaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.",
    "ai_generated_text": "The structure of three laminar, premixed, fuel-rich flames was examined: one pure methane flame and two methane flames enriched with allene and propyne, all operated under identical conditions in a low-pressure flat-flame burner. The study sought to clarify how unsaturated hydrocarbon additives influence flame chemistry, intermediate formation, and soot precursor pathways. Detailed *in situ* measurements of temperature profiles, stable species, and key intermediates were obtained via microprobe sampling combined with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Adding allene or propyne markedly altered the concentration profiles of C₃ and C₄ hydrocarbons, as well as aromatics, underscoring their effectiveness as precursors in benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation. Kinetic modeling using a comprehensive reaction mechanism mirrored the experimental trends and shed light on dominant reaction pathways. Findings show that both additives promote the generation of resonantly stabilized radicals, accelerating aromatic ring growth and soot inception. A comparative analysis between the allene- and propyne-doped flames revealed subtle variations in intermediate distributions, tied to differences in molecular structure and initial decomposition routes. This work deepens understanding of rich flame chemistry and provides valuable data for validating combustion models pertinent to pollutant formation."

In this setting, particles possess discrete types that shape both their spatial diffusion rates and reproduction rules. The high-temperature phase arises when type-dependent drift and branching are strongly disrupted by stochastic noise, causing rapid loss of lineage correlations and heightened spatial mixing. We introduce a refined martingale framework to capture the asymptotic growth of the population and establish central limit theorems for aggregate observables, highlighting universal features across diverse type spaces. Our approach blends spine decompositions with spectral analysis of the linearized generator, uncovering a transition from ballistic to diffusive scaling in spatial distributions. In addition, we determine the limiting empirical type distribution and specify conditions under which it converges to the stationary measure of the underlying type Markov chain. These findings extend earlier low-temperature results and furnish a rigorous probabilistic account of the high-temperature regime, with implications for models in population genetics, ecological dispersal, and multi-type particle systems in random environments."

We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change ofthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan hascomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which islinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic inthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reactionfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of thequadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentricorbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetryaxis.

To linear order in the mass ratio,to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, weshow that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such asystem (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole).

The quadrupole moment drives secular variations in orbital elements — including inclination, argument of periapsis, and eccentricity — which interact with dissipative dynamics via radiation reaction, yielding corrections to the standard inspiral behavior. By expanding the equations of motion to first order in both \\(Q\\) and the radiation reaction parameter, we obtain analytical formulas for the averaged rates of change of the orbital elements over many cycles. These expressions uncover resonant phenomena when orbital precession frequencies approach commensurate ratios, resulting in either amplification or suppression of gravitational wave energy flux depending on the orbit’s orientation relative to the symmetry axis.

Thus, a space-based microlensing survey islikely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the natureof planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation andhabitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is anexample of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish theseobjectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under theNASA Discovery Program cost cap.",

By harnessing continuous, high-cadence monitoring of dense stellar fields toward the Galactic bulge, the mission will capture fleeting magnification events triggered when planetary systems transit in front of background stars. Unlike ground-based efforts, a space observatory provides uninterrupted coverage, highly stable photometry, and access to infrared wavelengths, reducing extinction and enabling precise characterization of host stars. Its sensitivity extends from sub-Earth-mass planets to gas giants at orbital separations from roughly 0.5 AU to several tens of AU, complementing the discovery space explored by transit and radial velocity techniques. Analyzing thousands of such events will refine estimates of planet occurrence rates, mass distributions, and orbital architectures across the Milky Way, offering decisive tests of planet formation theories. Moreover, simultaneous parallax measurements from space and ground facilities will yield accurate determinations of lens masses and distances. This exhaustive census will deepen our understanding of planetary system structures and the prevalence of potentially habitable worlds, advancing knowledge of planetary demographics on a Galactic scale."

By directly calculating concurrence and other entanglement measures, we pinpoint conditions where local dynamics boost shared entanglement, as well as scenarios where they diminish it. These behaviors are interpreted in terms of information exchange between the interacting qubit and its environment, with emphasis on coherence retention and phase relationships. The examples challenge the common assumption that local noise necessarily reduces entanglement; certain coherent couplings can channel correlations from the ancilla to the unaffected qubit via the shared entangled state.

A key issue examined is thedetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is oftenempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrumfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot bepre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretionrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earliersuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling thedisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra canbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the colorcorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectrawith other models.

We demonstrate that assumptions about disk inclination, ionization gradients, and emissivity profiles can introduce systematic biases in estimates of black hole spin, mass, and accretion rate. By generating synthetic spectra from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with detailed ray-tracing, we quantify the degeneracies between spin and disk structure, revealing that even high signal-to-noise observations cannot fully disentangle these correlations without supplementary constraints from timing or multi-wavelength data. We also assess the influence of calibration uncertainties in current X-ray instruments, stressing the importance of cross-mission spectral consistency.

This transition aligns with a shift in the fragmentation scale, driven by the interplay between gravitational instability and the dissipation of turbulent energy. Above the threshold, collapse proceeds in a monolithic manner, yielding a few massive stellar cores; below it, intensified small-scale turbulence and magnetic support promote extensive fragmentation, producing an IMF biased toward low-mass objects. We quantify this shift by tracking the core mass function and star formation efficiency over time, revealing a consistent bifurcation in parameter space. The results indicate that environmental factors—such as galactic shear or turbulence induced by feedback—can govern the prevailing star formation mode.

We study different coding strategies inthe single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given themyriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routingproblem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from thesource to the destination. We find that for a given route, thedecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperativecoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable bythe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperativecoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in termsof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithmruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm thatruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route whenthe nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategiesusing practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance ofthe strategies on different routes.",

Our work examines various coding strategies in a single-source, single-destination setup with one or more intermediate relays. We focus on evaluating performance trade-offs among decode-and-forward, compress-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward schemes under realistic channel conditions, including fading and noise. Using information-theoretic methods, we develop a unified analytical framework to characterize achievable rate regions for each approach, factoring in power constraints and relay positioning. We assess the impact of cooperation on network capacity for both full-duplex and half-duplex relays, paying close attention to synchronization demands and protocol overhead. Simulations corroborate our theoretical analysis, demonstrating that cooperative relaying can substantially improve throughput and reliability compared to direct transmission, particularly in low-SNR scenarios. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive hybrid method that switches between coding schemes based on real-time channel state information, delivering notable gains in diverse environments. Our results offer practical insights for designing cooperative protocols that strike a balance between complexity and efficiency, along with guidance for optimizing relay-assisted wireless networks in emerging fields such as IoT, vehicular communications, and next-generation cellular systems."

The individuals of each species arelocalized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rulesare inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels ofmean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent toan extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonizedby prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximationis capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. Thepair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence ofprey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time andanother displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the populationdensities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise througha Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditionsand, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend oninitial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically morerealistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.",
    "ai_generated_text": "We investigate a probabilistic cellular automaton that captures the dynamics of predator–prey coexistence. Each species consists of local agents occupying discrete lattice sites, interacting with nearby neighbors through stochastic rules governing reproduction, predation, and mortality. Predators hunt prey within a limited neighborhood, prey spread into adjacent empty sites, and both species face random death events. This framework extends the classical Lotka–Volterra model by integrating spatial correlations and intrinsic noise, enabling the emergence of intricate spatiotemporal patterns. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we identify regimes of sustained coexistence, predator die-off, and prey overabundance, driven by control parameters such as reproduction rates and predation efficiency. Phase transitions between these regimes are characterized through order parameters derived from species densities and spatial correlation lengths. The results demonstrate that spatial structure and randomness can promote coexistence even in regions where mean-field approaches predict extinction. Naturally arising patterns—such as traveling waves and patchy distributions—emerge from local interactions and finite-size effects. These findings underscore the value of spatially explicit stochastic models for understanding ecological dynamics and offer a framework for probing the resilience of predator–prey systems under environmental variability."

This paper introduces the notion of \"canonicalnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacitiescan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that thethroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upperbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are manyhops away.

Our simulations show that 802.11 networks withrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs farbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near thegateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) tofashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can beimproved significantly by more than 150%.

Through analytical derivations based on the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), validated by simulation, we measure how spatial reuse, hidden-terminal effects, and collision probabilities erode aggregate throughput as the number of sources grows. The results show that throughput fails to scale proportionally with the number of sources, becoming constrained by saturated links near the sink where traffic converges and contention peaks. We extend the analysis to symmetric one-to-many cases, demonstrating that the same limiting factors arise due to the bidirectional nature of channel access. Practical implications are explored for network design, including strategic relay placement, channel allocation, and scheduling policies to ease congestion near aggregation points.
