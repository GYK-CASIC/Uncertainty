    "ai_generated_text": "A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation, has gained some attention in recent years due to its close relation to techniques developed in loop quantum gravity. Unlike the usual Schrödinger representation, the polymer framework is inherently discontinuous in its configuration or momentum variables, leading to a fundamentally discrete kinematic structure. This discreteness induces modifications to the spectra of operators, alters the semiclassical limit, and can serve as a simplified arena to study quantum geometry effects without fully engaging with the complexities of a gravitational field. We analyze the polymer representation in the context of simple mechanical systems, such as the harmonic oscillator and free particle, highlighting its mathematical construction via non-separable Hilbert spaces and the resulting lack of weak continuity in translation operators. Physical consequences, including deviations from standard dynamical evolutions and the emergence of modified dispersion relations, are discussed with emphasis on potential phenomenological implications. Furthermore, we explore possible regularization schemes and the role of shadow states in connecting the polymer framework to the conventional Schrödinger picture. Our results underscore the utility of the polymer representation both as a toy model and as a testbed for quantum gravity-inspired corrections."

These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s.

Evidencefor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,confirming the result of Belle et al.

Spin-modulated variability is detected across multiple emission lines, reflecting changes in accretion geometry and magnetically controlled flow structures over the decade-long interval. The optical spectra reveal strong Balmer, He I, and He II features, with equivalent widths and line profiles that vary on both the spin and orbital timescales. Doppler tomography indicates a persistent accretion disk with hotspots near the stream–disk interaction region, while high-velocity wings suggest magnetically channeled accretion curtains. Comparison between epochs shows modest but significant evolution in the velocity distribution, consistent with variations in mass transfer rate and inner-disk truncation radius. Radial-velocity curves yield an updated white dwarf spin ephemeris and confirm a stable orbital period within measurement uncertainty. The observed line asymmetries and continuum modulation imply partial optical depth changes correlated with the spin phase. These results demonstrate that EX Hya maintains a quasi-steady-state accretion configuration in quiescence, while subtle spectroscopic differences point to long-term adjustment in magnetic coupling and disk structure. The dataset provides a rare temporal benchmark for testing magnetohydrodynamic models of accretion in short-period intermediate polars."

The model also suggeststhat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided byALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the coolgas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models ofthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations ofthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) revealsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longerperiods in network regions.

Using multi-line diagnostics in the near-ultraviolet and infrared, we quantify the spatial and temporal variability of temperature and density fluctuations across different magnetic regimes, particularly focusing on network and internetwork regions. The simulations reproduce several observed features such as spicule-like jets, shock-driven brightenings, and intermittent heating events, highlighting the crucial role of magnetic reconnection and acoustic wave dissipation. Our results demonstrate that energy transport in the chromosphere is dominated by non-linear, intermittent processes rather than steady flows and can vary by orders of magnitude on sub-arcsecond scales. These findings provide new constraints for empirical heating models and offer insight into how energy is transferred toward the corona. We conclude that resolving the multi-scale dynamics of the chromosphere requires simultaneous observations with both high spatial fidelity and rapid temporal cadence, coupled with realistic three-dimensional numerical modeling."

By applying both numerical simulations and analytical approximations, we investigate how the number of modification sites, enzyme saturation levels, and distributive versus processive mechanisms contribute to signal amplification and switching thresholds. Our results highlight that increasing the number of phosphorylation sites can sharpen response curves, enhancing decision-making fidelity in signaling cascades. Moreover, under enzyme saturation, intermediate states can be bypassed, leading to effective bistable switches even without cooperative interactions. We also explore the impact of stochastic fluctuations on cycle dynamics, revealing that multisite organization can act as a noise filter, promoting robustness in fluctuating environments.

The limiter design is general and does not rely on ad hoc parameter tuning; instead, it adapts in response to the evolving entropy production in the system. We present a theoretical analysis demonstrating the preservation of key LBM properties—including conservation laws, Galilean invariance, and second-order accuracy—in smooth regions.

A combination of perturbation analysis and high‑resolution numerical simulations is used to examine the competition between shoaling, dispersion, and frictional decay. The results highlight how energy loss due to bottom friction modifies the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion, leading to changes in wave amplitude, speed, and profile asymmetry. Comparisons with constant‑depth and frictionless cases reveal distinct regimes in which solitary waves disintegrate into secondary pulses or stabilize into damped periodic structures.

We introduce and investigate globally the geometric structures that characterize Finsler spaces endowed with supplementary constraints on their metric tensors and connection forms. Our approach focuses on the interplay between curvature properties, torsion phenomena, and the integrability conditions associated with distinguished vector fields and distributions within the manifold. By constructing an adapted geometric framework, we reformulate several local results in a coordinate-free global setting, ensuring compatibility with standard differential-geometric tools. The paper analyzes the relationships between Cartan, Berwald, and Chern connections under special curvature restrictions and their implications for geodesic behavior and metric homogeneity. Furthermore, we present new criteria for the existence of special Finsler structures admitting parallel metrics and discuss their relevance to both variational principles and geometric mechanics. The global perspective developed here unifies previous local treatments and extends the applicability of the theory to compact and non-compact manifolds, emphasizing the role of smooth global sections and tensorial invariants. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of how special Finsler geometry fits into the broader context of generalized metric structures on differentiable manifolds."

The bonding in the potassium‑graphite compound is analyzed in terms of charge transfer, structural relaxation, and electronic redistribution between host carbon layers and guest alkali atoms. Density functional theory calculations reveal that potassium donates nearly one electron per atom to graphite, resulting in strong ionic interactions and weak covalent contributions that stabilize the interlayer spacing. The optimized structure corresponds to KC₈ stoichiometry with substantial expansion along the c‑axis, consistent with experimental measurements of graphite intercalation compounds. Electronic band structure and projected density of states demonstrate that electron donation from potassium shifts the Fermi level deep into the conduction band of graphite, creating a metallic state with enhanced anisotropic conductivity. Bader charge analysis confirms significant electron accumulation on the graphene sheets and depletion around the intercalated species, while total energy comparisons indicate favorable binding relative to pure graphite and metallic potassium. The computed formation energy and electronic properties highlight the crucial role of charge transfer in defining the chemical and physical characteristics of alkali‑metal intercalated graphite.

The resulting parameters indicate that the companion lies near the transition between very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, providing an important test case for empirical mass–radius relations in this regime. We compare our measurements with predictions from current stellar evolution models, finding consistency within uncertainties but a slight radius inflation relative to theoretical expectations, possibly linked to magnetic activity or tidal interactions. The system’s precise geometry allows an independent verification of spectroscopic surface gravity and effective temperature estimates.

The approach delineates how off-shell nilpotency ensures closure of the BRST algebra independent of the equations of motion, while on-shell closure emerges naturally in reduced phase-space formulations. We show that the introduction of auxiliary fields not only facilitates off-shell completeness but also clarifies the cohomological structure underlying physical state selection in the Hilbert space. The interplay between the two types of nilpotency is examined through explicit examples in Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories, highlighting differences in gauge-fixing procedures and corresponding path-integral measures. Our analysis confirms that preserving both off-shell and on-shell nilpotent structures enhances the robustness of perturbative calculations and deepens the connection between BRST symmetry, topological aspects of gauge theories, and quantization schemes rooted in the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism.

We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that clusters with higher ρ_h tend to have higher characteristic masses and narrower mass distributions, while low-ρ_h clusters exhibit lower peak masses and a more extended low-mass tail. These trends are reproduced by models in which mass loss rates scale inversely with relaxation time, leading to more rapid depletion of low-mass clusters in denser systems. The observed dependence is incompatible with a purely universal initial mass function unaffected by internal dynamical processes. By comparing to a suite of Monte Carlo cluster evolution models, we infer that much of the present-day GCMF variation can be explained by cumulative stellar escape over a Hubble time, starting from an initial power-law distribution.

According to this property the space-time dynamics in such geometries simplifies in a way that renders scattering amplitudes, propagators, and certain interaction vertices independent of the detailed structure of the underlying theory, depending only on the universal features of the pp-wave metric. This arises because pp-wave backgrounds admit large isometry groups and parallel null Killing vectors, allowing a consistent truncation of transverse dynamics and an exact treatment of longitudinal modes. We formulate the universality in terms of covariant perturbation theory and identify the class of operators that remain unaffected by higher-curvature or matter-coupling deformations. Examples from gauge theory, scalar field models, and string worldsheet descriptions illustrate that the effective action in light-cone gauge inherits identical kinematical structures, leading to theory-independent scaling of correlation functions. Moreover, the property holds beyond leading order in perturbations, provided the background satisfies certain curvature constraints. Potential applications include simplifications in holographic dualities, high-energy approximations in gravitational wave regimes, and the robustness of plane-wave limits for strongly coupled systems.

    "ai_generated_text": "The results of the spectral, energetical and temporal characteristics of radiation in the presence of the photonic flame effect are presented. Artificial opal-based photonic crystals were used as the primary medium for investigation under controlled excitation by short laser pulses. The observed emission patterns demonstrate strong dependence on the internal periodicity of the dielectric structure and the degree of local defect formation. Spectral measurements reveal narrow-band features emerging from the interaction between localized optical modes and the excitation field, accompanied by nonlinear enhancement of the radiative output. Energetic analysis indicates that a significant fraction of the input energy is stored temporarily in near-field electromagnetic modes before being released as structured radiation. Time-resolved data show emission lifetimes spanning several orders of magnitude, suggesting a coupling mechanism between transient photonic states and thermal relaxation processes. The experimental results are supported by numerical modeling based on finite-difference time-domain simulations, confirming the role of resonant field confinement in the generation of the photonic flame effect. These findings open prospects for developing novel light sources with controllable spectral signatures and for exploring energy localization phenomena in three-dimensional photonic lattices."

    "ai_generated_text": "**Abstract:**  \nStatistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by experimental data via a kernel estimator that links discrete observations to a continuous representation of the underlying physical behavior. In this framework, the kernel function serves as a bridge between stochastic fluctuations in measurements and deterministic theoretical models, allowing one to infer hidden parameters and quantify uncertainties in observed phenomena. The paper explores optimal kernel selection, bandwidth estimation, and bias–variance trade-offs to ensure that the reconstructed distributions accurately reproduce physical laws within experimental noise limits. Special attention is given to physical systems where measurement precision varies with signal intensity, requiring adaptive, data-driven smoothing strategies. Analytical expressions and numerical simulations demonstrate how the proposed approach effectively captures non-Gaussian features, multimodality, and nonlinear dependencies that often arise in real experiments. The methodology is validated on representative datasets from condensed matter and optical physics, evidencing improved consistency between theoretical predictions and probabilistic reconstructions. Ultimately, this study establishes a robust statistical mechanism for translating empirical data into physically interpretable laws, reinforcing the role of kernel-based probability density estimation as a fundamental tool in modern experimental analysis."

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spina=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbitswhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respectto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact oppositeto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration).

Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

In this work, we present a hybrid framework that combines non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer calculations with machine-learning emulators trained on high-fidelity physical models. The emulators rapidly estimate line intensities and ratios while preserving the accuracy of full radiative transfer solutions, allowing for Bayesian inference of key parameters within minutes rather than hours. We validate our method on synthetic data from molecular cloud models and demonstrate its ability to retrieve accurate gas properties under varying optical depths and excitation conditions. Applied to recent observations from ALMA and JWST, the approach achieves consistent fits and robust uncertainty quantification. This framework offers a scalable and generalizable tool for interpreting large spectral surveys and facilitates a more efficient connection between observed molecular emission and underlying astrochemical processes."

The redundancy is expressed by theentropy of information pertaining to the probability density function ofexperimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due tointegration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancyis derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data aboutthese variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation ofthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information andinformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity ofthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experimentsneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the costfunction. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics isdemonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.",
    "ai_generated_text": "**Abstract:**  \nRedundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be quantitatively inferred. This work develops a unified framework linking redundancy, information entropy, and experimental design optimization for systems exhibiting nonlinear or multiscale behavior. By modeling data redundancy as a statistical measure of mutual dependence among observations, we propose an analytical criterion for determining when additional experiments cease to contribute new information about the underlying process. The approach integrates Bayesian inference with information-theoretic metrics to dynamically assess experimental sufficiency and to quantify the effective dimensionality of the investigated phenomenon. Applications to both synthetic and real datasets—including fluid turbulence and biochemical reaction networks—demonstrate that redundancy-driven metrics reliably predict the transition from data scarcity to data saturation. Furthermore, the framework identifies which parameters of a system contribute most to informational gain, providing a principled basis for adaptive experimental planning. The results suggest that redundancy-based measures can serve as a general tool to balance experimental cost against achievable knowledge, fostering more efficient exploration of complex natural systems."

The high spatial and spectral resolution afforded by {\\it Chandra} allows us to disentangle contributions from shocked ejecta and circumstellar material, providing critical insights into the dynamics and composition of the remnant. We summarize measurements of the changing X-ray morphology, light curve, and line spectra, emphasizing the transition from domination by the inner equatorial ring to the emergence of the outer structures as the shock front continues to advance. The data reveal a complex interplay between radiative cooling, hydrodynamic instabilities, and the gradual development of reverse shocks that heat the ejecta to X-ray–emitting temperatures. By combining these observations with complementary data at optical and radio wavelengths, we refine models of energy dissipation and chemical mixing in young supernova remnants. Our long-term {\\it Chandra} campaign thus provides an unparalleled view of the transformation from explosion to remnant in real time."

Here we analyze the performance ofRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selectedfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributedentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest.

This paper investigates methods for designing efficient feedback and precoding schemes under practical constraints such as limited feedback bandwidth, quantization error, and channel estimation uncertainty. We present a unified framework that models the feedback process as a stochastic optimization problem, jointly optimizing the feedback strategy and the precoding design. Analytical expressions for the achievable rate are derived under both perfect and imperfect channel state information, highlighting the trade-offs between feedback resolution, system complexity, and spectral efficiency. The proposed approach integrates adaptive codebook selection and statistical channel modeling to minimize feedback overhead while preserving near-optimal performance. Numerical simulations demonstrate significant improvements in throughput compared with conventional linear precoding and fixed codebook designs, especially in rapidly time-varying environments.

In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in theH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in theV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contraryto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights ofNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours.

    "ai_generated_text": "Spectral variability is the main tool for constraining emission models of BL Lac objects. By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS 2155–304, we investigate the temporal evolution of its broadband spectral energy distribution during a series of multi‐epoch campaigns spanning the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. The simultaneous coverage enables a detailed comparison of flux and spectral index variations, allowing us to trace the interplay between synchrotron and inverse-Compton components under varying physical conditions. We apply time-resolved spectral fitting based on homogeneous and inhomogeneous leptonic scenarios, quantifying changes in particle acceleration efficiency, magnetic field strength, and Doppler boosting. The results reveal correlated spectral hardening during flaring episodes and an asymmetric rise–decay behavior consistent with rapid injection followed by radiative cooling. We further demonstrate that the observed spectral trends can be reproduced by a stochastic acceleration model with energy‐dependent timescales. This systematic analysis emphasizes the importance of dense temporal sampling and multiwavelength synergy to isolate the mechanisms governing BL Lac spectral variability. Our findings provide stringent constraints on emission zone geometry and plasma conditions, offering a refined framework for interpreting variability patterns in blazar jets."

Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates ina spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on theother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detectionadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, andreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populatedthan the jovian mass range.

Aims: This motivates planet searches around stars which sample a broad range of stellar masses, particularly those underrepresented in current surveys, to assess trends in occurrence rate, orbital architecture, and composition. Methods: We conducted a targeted radial velocity and transit photometry campaign focusing on intermediate-mass subgiants and low-mass M dwarfs, using high-precision spectrographs and space-based light curves. Stellar parameters were derived from spectral modeling and isochrone fitting, while planetary parameters were inferred through joint orbital modeling of RV and transit data. Results: We report the detection of several new planets spanning super-Earth to Jovian masses, with measured orbital periods from days to hundreds of days. Comparative analysis reveals an increasing occurrence of low-mass planets toward lower-mass hosts, while giant planets appear more prevalent around stars exceeding ~1.5 M☉. Host star mass also correlates with semi-major axis distribution, suggesting migration pathways vary with stellar mass.

In this work, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope events across a range of mass ratios and evolutionary states, focusing on the interplay between drag forces, envelope unbinding efficiency, and angular momentum transport. Our models incorporate realistic stellar profiles and radiative cooling processes to capture the energetics of envelope ejection. We find that the efficiency of envelope removal strongly depends on the internal structure of the donor, with more centrally concentrated envelopes requiring significantly more orbital energy for ejection. The simulations reveal complex flow morphologies, including persistent spiral shocks and large-scale polar outflows that may contribute to asymmetric mass loss observable in post-common-envelope nebulae. We also quantify the dependence of the final orbital separation on initial conditions, providing constraints for binary population synthesis models.

We find that the overall binary fraction of acluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at latetimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in thecentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a corebinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining).

Our analysis aims to characterize the leading-order deviations from general relativity that arise due to the inclusion of the parity-violating Chern-Simons correction. Starting from a perturbative expansion around Minkowski spacetime, we derive the modified metric potentials by solving the coupled system of the gravitational and scalar field equations. The perfect fluid is modeled through its standard stress-energy tensor, allowing us to capture realistic astrophysical systems such as slowly rotating stars or quasi-stationary binary configurations. We identify the explicit form of the Chern-Simons contribution to the gravitomagnetic sector at first post-Newtonian order, isolating the terms that influence frame dragging and orbital precession. Furthermore, we discuss the conditions under which the scalar field evolution remains consistent with solar-system tests, and we provide scaling relations between the Chern-Simons coupling strength and observable effects. Our results supply a systematic framework for connecting theoretical predictions of Chern-Simons gravity with future precision experiments, offering a foundation for constraining parity-violating extensions of general relativity through post-Newtonian phenomenology."

Our models reveal that gas streams penetrating the central gap can sustain intermittent accretion onto both stellar components, with mass transfer rates that depend sensitively on disk viscosity and binary eccentricity. Synthetic spectral energy distributions and continuum emission maps derived from the simulations reproduce key features observed in young binaries such as DQ Tau and GG Tau, including transient brightenings associated with periastron passages. We find that even for systems with relatively large cleared regions, low-density filaments can maintain connectivity between the circumbinary disk and circumstellar disks over timescales comparable to the binary’s orbital period. These results imply that disk clearing does not impose a strict cut-off in accretion activity, but instead leads to complex time-variable flow patterns that influence both stellar and disk evolution.

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the directmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, forboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes itstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-typegalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass functionwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxysample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, andintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the localmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-typegalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}.

Local nano-frictionexperiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine theevolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure forthe different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressurein the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent frictioncoefficient is high ($\\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC togetherwith ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPathrough some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <$\\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planessliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when thepressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.",

The study aims to elucidate how the dynamic formation and evolution of tribofilms influence friction reduction and load-bearing performance under mixed lubrication conditions. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and nanoindentation analyses reveal that the films possess a heterogeneous stratification consisting of amorphous and nanocrystalline regions, whose mechanical response is strongly dependent on contact history and thermal exposure. Rheometry conducted on extracted tribofilms indicates viscoelastic behavior resulting from their composite microstructure and the presence of boundary-active reaction products. Correlation of the film’s morphology with local shear deformation enables the identification of mechanisms governing the transition from protective to wear-promoting regimes. The insights gained demonstrate that the interplay between chemical film growth, shear-induced structural rearrangement, and rheological adaptation controls overall tribological performance. This work provides a framework for predictive modeling of the mechanical integrity of anti-wear films and for the design of lubricant formulations with enhanced durability under high-stress mechanical contacts."

The new observations, obtained at several frequencies between 1.4 and 15 GHz, provide milliarcsecond resolution imaging that reveals a variety of structural types, including symmetric double-lobed systems and core-jet morphologies. Spectral index maps derived from matched-resolution images confirm steep spectra across most components, consistent with ongoing energy losses and limited active particle acceleration. For several objects, the measured brightness distributions and hotspot separations suggest projected linear sizes below one kiloparsec, reinforcing their classification as genuinely compact rather than foreshortened large sources. Combined with earlier results for the full sample, these data support an evolutionary scenario in which CSS objects represent an early stage of radio galaxy development prior to large-scale jet expansion.

The three flames havebeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentrationprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after samplingwith a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide anddioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using aPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in ourlaboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons.

    "ai_generated_text": "The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a pure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propene. Experiments were carried out under identical pressure, equivalence ratio, and flow conditions to isolate the influence of the dopants on flame chemistry and structure. Temperature profiles were measured using fine-wire thermocouples, and stable and intermediate species concentrations were determined via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The addition of unsaturated hydrocarbons, specifically allene and propene, was found to significantly alter the formation pathways of C₂ and C₃ species, affecting both the onset of aromatic ring formation and the distribution of reactive radicals. Detailed kinetic modeling, using updated reaction mechanisms for small unsaturated hydrocarbons, reproduced experimental trends and elucidated the key reaction channels responsible for the observed differences. Allene doping promoted rapid propargyl radical production, accelerating benzene precursor formation, while propene addition favored allyl radical pathways, leading to distinct aromatic growth patterns. The integrated analysis reveals that minor changes in fuel composition can strongly influence soot precursor formation in rich methane flames, offering insights into controlling pollutant emissions in practical combustion systems through targeted fuel modification."

In the high temperature regime, corresponding to small inverse noise parameters, we establish sharp asymptotics for the annealed and quenched generating functions and characterize the limiting form of the empirical type distribution. By employing martingale transform techniques and spectral analysis of associated linear operators, we derive explicit criteria distinguishing the stable and unstable phases. The joint scaling limit reveals a universal Gaussian fluctuation structure, generalizing previous results for single-type branching diffusions. Moreover, we identify the emergence of a mean-field behavior where correlation effects become negligible, leading to an effective decoupling between spatial and type dynamics.

The analysis of spatial correlations between secondary fragments recorded in emulsion layers enables precise identification of fragmentation channels involving α-particle and deuteron clusters, thereby offering insights into the intrinsic configuration of nucleons within the parent nuclei. Charge topology distributions and angular correlations indicate that cluster degrees of freedom strongly influence fragmentation dynamics, with coherent dissociation events providing direct evidence for compact multi-α systems. Comparisons between experimental observations and Monte Carlo simulations based on the Glauber model suggest a weak dependence on collision centrality for peripheral interactions, supporting the concept of preformed clusters surviving the break-up process.

By treating the quadrupolar deformation as a perturbation of the Schwarzschild background, we derive analytic expressions for the rate of change of orbital energy, angular momentum, and Carter-like constants under radiation reaction. The resulting evolution equations reveal cross-coupling terms between spin-independent relativistic corrections and quadrupole-induced precession, leading to measurable deviations in waveform phase accumulation for moderately eccentric and inclined trajectories. We further identify regimes in which the quadrupole’s alignment or obliquity enhances or suppresses the efficiency of gravitational-wave emission. These findings have direct implications for precision modeling of extreme mass ratio inspirals and tests of the no-hair theorem using space-based detectors.

The primary objective is to investigate how the intrinsic deformation of uranium nuclei influences baryon stopping, density evolution, and collective flow in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The model incorporates both mean-field potentials and baryon–baryon, baryon–meson, and meson–meson scattering channels within a relativistic framework to describe nonequilibrium dynamics during the overlap stage of the reaction. Simulations indicate that tip-tip orientations produce higher compression and longer interaction durations compared to body-body configurations, leading to enhanced stopping and a more isotropic momentum distribution near midrapidity. The degree of nuclear stopping and corresponding anisotropy in azimuthal distributions are found to depend sensitively on the nuclear equation of state and in-medium cross sections implemented in ART1.0. Comparisons with available experimental data and other transport models demonstrate that ART1.0 provides a consistent description of orientation-dependent observables, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of deformed-nucleus collisions and the properties of dense baryonic matter created in such reactions."

    "ai_generated_text": "A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth masses across a wide range of orbital separations, including planets beyond the snow line that are inaccessible to other detection methods. By continuously monitoring densely populated stellar fields in the Galactic bulge, such a mission will detect the transient magnification of background stars caused by planetary systems acting as gravitational lenses. The resulting data will yield precise measurements of the frequency, mass distribution, and orbital characteristics of planets from free-floaters to analogs of the Solar System’s outer giants. Combining microlensing results with those from transit and radial velocity surveys will enable the first comprehensive view of planetary architectures over ten orders of magnitude in orbital period and host star mass. A dedicated space platform avoids atmospheric limitations, improving photometric precision and temporal coverage essential for capturing short-lived planetary signals. The survey’s outcomes will not only constrain models of planet formation and migration but also illuminate the Galactic distribution and evolution of planetary systems. By revealing the true diversity of exoplanets, a space-based microlensing mission represents a cornerstone in understanding our place among planetary systems in the Milky Way."

By analyzing minimal models that include coupling to an external field, controlled rotations, and effective measurement processes, we demonstrate conditions under which local interactions act as entanglement amplifiers or suppressors depending on initial states and interaction parameters. The study clarifies the role of concurrence and von Neumann entropy as measures of entanglement variation under local evolution, and provides explicit analytic expressions for their time dependence.

The transition arises when localized turbulent dissipation triggers fragmentation into dense filaments, leading to a rapid increase in the number of low-mass protostellar cores. Below this threshold, star formation proceeds hierarchically, yielding a broad stellar mass spectrum consistent with observed initial mass functions. Above it, radiative heating and accretion flows maintain a top-heavy regime dominated by massive stars.

The fractal dimension of the cluster boundaries determines the distribution of pinning energies and the statistical characteristics of vortex detachment processes under applied current.

We find that for a given route, thedecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperativecoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable bythe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperativecoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in termsof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithmruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm thatruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route whenthe nodes transmit independent codewords.

The main objective is to characterize achievable rate regions and determine optimal resource allocation schemes that maximize throughput while minimizing power consumption. We consider decode-and-forward, compress-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward strategies, analyzing their performance under realistic fading channels and imperfect synchronization. Using stochastic geometric models and outage probability formulations, we derive closed-form expressions for expected network capacity and reliability metrics. Furthermore, we explore adaptive time and power allocation across relays based on channel state information and node positioning. Numerical simulations validate our analytical results and show significant improvements in spectral efficiency and energy utilization compared with non-cooperative schemes. Our analysis provides practical design guidelines for emerging cooperative and device-to-device communication systems, including applications in future 6G networks, wireless sensor systems, and intelligent transportation infrastructures. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of cooperative mechanisms within dynamic multi-hop architectures and highlight the potential benefits of joint coding and relay optimization in modern wireless environments."

The simple approximation is equivalent toan extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonizedby prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximationis capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. Thepair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence ofprey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time andanother displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the populationdensities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise througha Hopf bifurcation.

By systematically varying the interaction range and transition rates, we identify distinct dynamical regimes characterized by steady coexistence, oscillatory behavior, and extinction transitions. Monte Carlo simulations are complemented by a coarse-grained analytical approach based on pair approximations, providing insights into critical thresholds of survival and the emergence of spatial patterns such as clusters and traveling waves. The model exhibits a continuous transition between disordered and structured spatial phases, driven by stochastic coupling between local predator pressure and prey reproduction. We compare our results to deterministic reaction–diffusion formulations, highlighting the influence of noise and discreteness on long-term stability.

This dual accretion geometry produces complex photometric and spectroscopic variability, often characterized by distinct periodicities corresponding to both the orbital and spin periods, as well as beat frequencies arising from their interaction. We present a systematic analysis of multiwavelength observations of selected IPs, combining high time-resolution optical photometry with complementary X-ray data to investigate the coupling between the magnetic field and the accretion dynamics. Using phase-resolved spectroscopy, we constrain the structure of the accretion curtains and quantify changes in emission line profiles as a function of spin phase. Our results reveal correlations between X-ray pulse amplitude and optical emission-line flux, consistent with models in which the accretion flow is modulated by magnetically funneled curtains impacting the white dwarf’s surface.

The discussion connects Goedel’s completeness theorem, model theory, and algebraic semantics, emphasizing how Boolean identities correspond to provable consequences in the formal calculus.

The observations resolved thehot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatialresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far.

We find interesting chemical spatialdifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhancedat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperaturesensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. TheSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from thishot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hotcore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons forthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the mainsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to thelarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of thecentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk.

Using a combination of mean‑field theory, exact diagonalization, and tensor‑network techniques, we identify distinct phases characterized by long‑range entanglement and anyonic quasiparticle statistics.

Signatures of these exotic states include quantized fractional Hall responses, characteristic spectral gaps observable in numerical spectra, and discrete ground‑state degeneracies associated with nontrivial manifold topology.  Our results highlight the role of frustration and band topology as organizing principles for interaction‑driven fractionalization, suggesting experimental paths toward new correlated quantum phases in moiré materials, optical lattices, and engineered nanostructures.

This paper introduces the notion of \"canonicalnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacitiescan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that thethroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upperbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are manyhops away.

Our simulations show that 802.11 networks withrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs farbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near thegateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) tofashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can beimproved significantly by more than 150%.

We develop a precise formulation of the MAC-layer interactions using a combination of stochastic geometry and protocol-level analysis, leading to closed-form approximations for end-to-end throughput in both saturation and non-saturation regimes. Our results reveal that the aggregate throughput does not scale linearly with the number of sources; instead, it converges to an asymptotic ceiling determined by network topology and carrier-sensing range. The paper further examines optimization strategies such as adaptive backoff tuning and directional antenna deployment to mitigate interference and improve fairness. Comparative simulations in ns-3 confirm the accuracy of the analytical model across various network densities and traffic patterns. Ultimately, the work establishes theoretical limits for many-to-one and one-to-many communication in IEEE 802.11 mesh networks, providing guidelines for protocol design and efficient data aggregation in wireless sensor and ad hoc systems."

Comparison between measured and simulated diffusion coefficients reveals excellent quantitative agreement, confirming the accuracy of the interatomic potential and the reliability of the experimental procedures.

We find that metal-poor clusters predominantly form in early, low-mass progenitors prior to major mergers, while metal-rich clusters arise during intense, centrally concentrated starbursts triggered by gas-rich mergers and subsequent dissipative collapse.
