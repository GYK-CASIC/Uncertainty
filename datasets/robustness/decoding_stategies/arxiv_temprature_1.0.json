    "ai_generated_text": "A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation, has gained some attention in recent years due to its close association with loop quantum gravity and other background-independent approaches to quantum spacetime. Unlike the standard Schrödinger representation, the polymer framework relies on a discrete topology for configuration space, leading to a fundamentally different realization of position and momentum operators. This discrete structure induces a natural ultraviolet cutoff, modifies dispersion relations, and can profoundly alter the dynamical behaviour of quantum systems, especially at high energies or small length scales. In this work, we analyze the mathematical foundations of the polymer representation and its impact on simple quantum mechanical models, such as the harmonic oscillator and free particle, highlighting deviations from conventional predictions. We also investigate semiclassical limits, exploring how classical trajectories emerge despite the underlying non-standard quantization. Our results illustrate both the conceptual novelty and potential physical implications of polymer quantization, including its relevance as a toy model for quantum gravitational effects. The framework provides a fertile ground for testing ideas about discreteness in quantum theory, suggesting avenues for experimental bounds on possible departures from standard quantum mechanics."

Extended mid-infrared emission traces filamentary structures correlated with submillimeter dust continuum maps, indicating active accretion and feedback effects. Spectral index analysis suggests a broad range of evolutionary stages, from deeply embedded Class 0/I objects to more evolved Class II/III sources. The distribution of YSO classes, in conjunction with extinction maps derived from near-IR data, supports a scenario of hierarchical cloud fragmentation and triggered collapse.

These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s.

The Balmer and He II lines exhibit periodic Doppler shifts at the 67‑minute spin period, providing direct evidence for magnetically channeled flow onto discrete pole regions. Comparison between the two epochs indicates modest changes in line strengths and continuum slope, suggesting fluctuations in mass‑transfer rate while maintaining the overall accretion geometry. Velocity‑resolved profiles confirm the coexistence of disk and stream components, and cross‑correlation analysis constrains the projected velocity amplitude to approximately 300–400 km s⁻¹. The derived parameters imply a magnetic field of order 1–3 MG and an accretion luminosity consistent with earlier X‑ray measurements. These results refine models of EX Hya as a low‑accretion‑rate Intermediate Polar with a truncated disk and highlight the stability of its magnetically controlled accretion over decadal timescales.

By analyzing synthetic observables derived from 3D numerical models and comparing them with data from instruments such as DKIST and IRIS, we identify key signatures of small-scale magnetic reconnection and wave dissipation processes responsible for intermittent heating and fine structuring. Our results highlight that the chromosphere cannot be characterized by simple equilibrium assumptions but requires a fully dynamic treatment that accounts for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects and multi-fluid interactions. We also find that the coupling between acoustic shocks and magnetically guided flows produces transient fibrilar features that strongly influence energy transport into the transition region.

The study employs benchmark cases involving dielectric and metallic spheres and aggregates, for which analytical or high-precision numerical solutions exist. Our results reveal that careful control of dipole polarization interactions and grid resolution enables DDA to produce physically consistent cross sections even beyond conventional limits, albeit at rapidly increasing computational cost.

By dynamically constraining this deviation, the proposed limiters suppress nonphysical modes without compromising the accuracy or stability of the flow solution. Several functional forms of the limiter are investigated, including polynomial and nonlinear saturation models that preserve conservation laws and maintain a second-order convergence rate in smooth regions. Numerical experiments on canonical problems such as shock-tube flows and lid-driven cavities demonstrate that entropy-limited schemes effectively reproduce correct hydrodynamic behavior even at high Reynolds numbers and under coarse spatial discretization.

A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations.

Analytical and numerical approaches are employed to investigate how wave amplitude, speed, and profile evolve as the waves encounter topographic and frictional inhomogeneities. Using perturbation techniques and direct simulations, the study reveals that bathymetric variation induces adiabatic modulation of solitary wave parameters, while friction leads to progressive attenuation and slight deformation of the waveform. For periodic waves, a balance between nonlinearity, dispersion, and dissipation determines steady or decaying regimes depending on slope steepness and friction intensity. Comparisons between asymptotic predictions and numerical results demonstrate good agreement within the weakly nonlinear limit. The analysis highlights important energy-transfer mechanisms between the wave and the mean flow, with implications for coastal hydrodynamics and sediment transport.

We introduce and investigate globally defined geometric structures that characterize Finsler spaces endowed with additional symmetries or curvature constraints. Our approach emphasizes the interplay between the nonlinear connection, the Cartan and Chern (Rund) connections, and the curvature tensors that emerge in these frameworks. By developing an intrinsic, coordinate-free formulation, we extend several classical results of Riemannian and Finsler geometry to the setting of special Finsler manifolds endowed with compatible metric and connection systems. A particular focus is placed on the global behavior of these manifolds under transformations preserving the metric function, the relationship between the spray coefficients and the curvature operators, and the explicit characterization of complete and homogeneous examples. We establish criteria that distinguish subclasses such as Berwald, Landsberg, and locally Minkowski manifolds from a global viewpoint, and we demonstrate how these conditions influence geodesic completeness and the tensorial decomposition of curvature. The results form a unified geometric framework suitable for applications in global differential geometry and theoretical physics, where Finsler structures naturally model anisotropic or direction-dependent phenomena."

The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is analyzed through density functional calculations to elucidate charge transfer, electronic structure, and structural stability across varying stoichiometries. The results reveal that potassium atoms donate nearly one electron per atom to the carbon framework, forming predominantly ionic interactions between intercalant layers and graphene sheets. This electron transfer leads to notable changes in the graphite electronic bands, including the shift of the Fermi level and the emergence of metallic states associated with partially filled π* bands. Structural relaxation indicates that the most stable configuration corresponds to stage-I intercalation, with potassium arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice aligned with the graphite basal plane. The calculated interlayer spacing and cohesive energies agree well with available experimental data. Charge density and density-of-states analyses confirm that hybridization between potassium 4s and carbon π orbitals is minor, supporting an interpretation dominated by electrostatic interactions.

These rings interpolate between several well-known symmetric function families, including Hall–Littlewood, Jack, and Macdonald polynomials, and exhibit rich internal symmetries arising from specific automorphisms and involutions. We explore structural properties such as graded dimensions, stability under plethystic substitution, and duality under an extended scalar product, demonstrating how the parameter sequence governs deformation between classical cases. Furthermore, we identify Pieri-type formulas and branching rules that extend the Littlewood–Richardson theory to the parameterized setting. This framework allows for a unified approach to known identities and provides new expansions for products and skew functions. Applications include connections to the cohomology of generalized flag varieties, representation theory of Hecke algebras with unequal parameters, and enumerative combinatorics of weighted tableaux.

The paracommutation relations or some theirgeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validityof all Heisenberg equations.

For scalar fields, the standard equal-time commutation relations are recovered from the field–momentum correspondence, while alternative algebraic structures are considered in the context of generalized quantization schemes. Spinor fields are analyzed via their anticommutation relations, derived from the Dirac Lagrangian, emphasizing the role of Lorentz covariance and the exclusion of negative-norm states. For vector fields, both massive and massless cases are systematically studied, with attention given to the subtleties of gauge fixing, subsidiary conditions, and representation theory of the Poincaré group. We classify permissible commutation relations according to their compatibility with the field equations, microcausality, and positivity of the energy spectrum. The analysis shows that, although the standard canonical and anticanonical relations remain the most physically viable, certain alternative algebraic forms can emerge in constrained or extended formulations, potentially relevant to quantization in curved spacetimes or nontrivial topologies.

We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}.

We find that low-density clusters exhibit a turnover mass significantly below that of high-density systems, consistent with accelerated dynamical evaporation and preferential destruction of low-mass members. Conversely, dense clusters retain nearly their initial mass distributions, implying longer relaxation times and reduced external stripping. The observed correlation between GCMF shape and ρ_h can be reproduced by evolutionary models incorporating a universal initial cluster mass function and density-dependent dissolution timescales.

Artificial opal structures, composed of periodically arranged dielectric microspheres, were excited under controlled optical and thermal conditions to investigate their nonlinear light emission properties. The study focuses on the formation and evolution of transient luminescent regions—colloquially termed photonic “flames”—arising from localized field enhancement and multiphoton processes within the opal lattice. Spectroscopic analysis revealed discrete emission bands correlated with the excitation wavelength and the geometry of the photonic crystal, suggesting strong coupling between localized defect modes and plasma-like surface states. Energy measurements indicated high conversion efficiency from input optical pulses to visible and near-infrared radiation, while temporal studies showed emission lifetimes extending beyond typical scattering relaxation times, implying sustained coherent feedback within the lattice. The observed dynamics point to a complex interplay between phonon-assisted recombination and nonlinear optical amplification. These findings provide new insight into light–matter interactions in structured dielectric media and suggest pathways toward designing controllable photonic sources and sensors based on ordered nanoparticle assemblies."

It is derived directly from thekernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. Theproposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisychaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predicta future value of chaotic time series from the present one.

It is expressed by experimental data via a kernel approach that enables the reconstruction of underlying stochastic relationships without imposing restrictive analytic assumptions. In physical experiments, random fluctuations and measurement noise obscure deterministic dependencies, motivating the use of nonparametric kernel estimators to recover empirical probability densities. This paper develops a unified framework for connecting kernel-based density estimation with the identification of physical laws expressed through regression and differential relationships among observables. The methodology incorporates adaptive bandwidth selection guided by physical constraints, ensuring consistency between statistical estimation and known conservation principles. Analytical derivations are complemented by simulation studies and comparisons with conventional least‑squares fitting, demonstrating improved robustness under non-Gaussian noise and limited sample sizes. Applications to thermodynamic, electrical, and optical measurement datasets illustrate how kernel representations reveal subtle nonlinear effects traditionally averaged out in parametric models. The proposed framework thus bridges the gap between data‑driven statistical inference and theoretical physics modeling, supporting a probabilistic interpretation of empirical laws that accommodates uncertainty and complexity inherent to modern experimental systems."

By extending the traditional timing argument formulation—originally applied to the Milky Way–Andromeda system—to the cluster scale, we estimate the effective dynamical mass necessary to reproduce the observed velocity offset of the bullet-like subcluster under cosmologically plausible initial conditions. Our approach combines analytic approximations for infall trajectories with numerical integration of the perturbed potential, constrained by weak lensing measurements and shock-front morphologies. The resulting dark-to-baryonic mass ratio is shown to be consistent with standard ΛCDM expectations within one sigma, yet exhibits sensitivity to uncertainties in the subcluster’s line-of-sight velocity and gas stripping fraction.

The approach extends previous single scattering formalisms by incorporating the interference between different scattering channels, leading to an explicit expression for medium-induced corrections at the twist-four level. These corrections are shown to depend sensitively on the parton density distribution and nuclear size, introducing flavor-dependent asymmetries in hadron production rates. Numerical estimates for typical nuclear systems indicate that the additional rescattering terms lead to a moderate suppression at high momentum fractions and an enhancement at intermediate values, consistent with observed nuclear modification patterns in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and proton–nucleus collisions.

The temporal and spectral characteristics of the SE were studied under periodic modulation of the pumping field and detuning of the resonator modes. Experimental results reveal quasiperiodic and stochastic regimes of phonon generation, including self-organized mode alternation and synchronization phenomena analogous to those observed in optical and microwave electromagnetic lasers. Numerical simulations based on nonlinear rate equations reproduce the emergence of nonstationary SE patterns, demonstrating sensitivity to both modulation depth and frequency. Comparison between measured and computed spectra confirms the presence of low-frequency deterministic chaos in the amplitude dynamics. The results highlight the role of relaxation processes, intermode energy exchange, and external forcing in shaping the acoustic emission. These findings contribute to understanding nonequilibrium phonon-laser systems and may guide the development of controlled hypersound sources and advanced methods for information processing using coherent acoustic waves."

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spina=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbitswhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respectto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact oppositeto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

    "ai_generated_text": "The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared line observations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical and chemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances in a variety of astrophysical environments. Traditional radiative transfer methods, while accurate, can be computationally prohibitive when applied to extensive spectral datasets or large parameter spaces. In this work, we present a streamlined modeling framework that combines non-LTE excitation calculations with surrogate modeling algorithms to accelerate parameter estimation while retaining physical fidelity. The approach leverages precomputed grids of molecular line intensities, coupled with machine learning–based interpolation, to enable rapid synthesis of spectra matching observational constraints. We validate our method using synthetic datasets representative of star-forming regions and evolved stellar envelopes, comparing results to those obtained with full radiative transfer simulations. Our framework achieves parameter recovery with accuracy better than 10% for most test cases, while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude. This efficiency facilitates direct integration with Bayesian inference pipelines, allowing robust uncertainty quantification and exploration of complex chemical networks. The method is readily extensible to forthcoming high-resolution surveys, providing a practical pathway for exploiting the rich diagnostics available from modern radio and infrared spectroscopy."

The redundancy is expressed by theentropy of information pertaining to the probability density function ofexperimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due tointegration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancyis derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data aboutthese variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation ofthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information andinformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity ofthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experimentsneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the costfunction.

In this work, we propose a formal framework that connects data redundancy to the structural and dynamical complexity of physical, biological, and engineered systems. By modeling experiments as stochastic probes of an underlying information manifold, we demonstrate that redundancy acts as a measurable proxy for the system’s internal degrees of freedom. Using both analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we show that redundancy growth follows predictable scaling laws governed by entropy production and correlation length. This approach allows the estimation of when additional experimentation becomes inefficient, yielding an objective criterion for experimental sufficiency. Applications to turbulent flow measurements, gene expression profiling, and materials testing illustrate the universality of the method and its capacity to uncover hidden regimes where standard statistical descriptors fail. The results suggest that redundancy-based analysis provides a bridge between information theory and experimental design, offering a pathway toward self-optimizing research strategies that minimize cost while maximizing knowledge extraction from complex phenomena."

Results show that at lower temperatures the nanotube arrays maintain a near-perfect cylindrical symmetry with minimal bond length fluctuation, while increasing thermal energy leads to anisotropic expansion, curvature distortions, and reduced interlayer coherence. The tensile strength and Young’s modulus exhibit a nonlinear degradation trend, strongly correlated with the emergence of Stone–Wales defects and local bond rotations.

Partially Contained Events, characterized by exiting tracks traversing into the outer detector, extend sensitivity to higher-energy neutrinos with more forward-peaked angular responses. By binning events according to reconstructed zenith angles, the analysis probes differences in upward-going versus downward-going fluxes, which are sensitive to varying path lengths through the Earth. Comparison of observed distributions to Monte Carlo simulations without oscillations reveals a significant deficit in upward-going muon-type neutrinos, consistent with ν_μ→ν_τ oscillations. Systematic uncertainties from detector calibration, atmospheric neutrino flux modeling, and interaction cross-sections are carefully incorporated into the fit. The combined sample allows extraction of oscillation parameters with improved constraints, yielding best-fit values in agreement with previous SK results.

We present a review of its X-ray evolution over more than two decades, focusing on the transition from ejecta–circumstellar interaction to the emergence of reverse-shock–heated material. Early observations revealed a rapid brightening as the expanding blast wave encountered dense structures in the equatorial ring, producing prominent soft X-ray emission dominated by thermal plasma at temperatures of a few keV. Subsequent monitoring has shown a gradual softening of the spectrum, accompanied by changes in line flux ratios that trace the shock deceleration and evolving elemental abundances. High-resolution grating spectra enable diagnostics of the ionization state, shock velocities, and density contrasts within the ring. More recently, evidence has emerged for a contribution from inner ejecta heated by the reverse shock and possible signatures of compact object activity.

Here we analyze the performance ofRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selectedfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributedentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examplesshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is onlyslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matchedfilter can require significantly more feedback.",

In this work, we analyze the impact of limited and imperfect channel state information (CSI) feedback on the achievable rate and robustness of MIMO precoding strategies. We consider both frequency-division duplex (FDD) and time-division duplex (TDD) systems, modeling realistic feedback constraints such as quantization noise, latency, and packet loss. Using a stochastic channel model, we derive closed-form expressions for the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) under quantized precoder updates and propose an adaptive feedback scheduling policy that balances feedback overhead against performance gains. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal spectral efficiency compared to full CSI feedback while substantially reducing feedback load. Moreover, the framework exhibits resilience to moderate delays and feedback errors, making it suitable for high-mobility scenarios. The theoretical analysis further reveals trade-offs between feedback granularity, spatial correlation, and achievable degrees of freedom, providing design guidelines for next-generation wireless systems that employ MIMO precoding under realistic feedback constraints.

We assess the degree of concordance between observed scaling relations—such as mass–temperature and mass–concentration—and predictions from ΛCDM-based simulations, identifying systematic offsets attributable to projection effects and non-thermal pressure support. Discrepancies in mass estimates across techniques are explored in the context of cluster triaxiality and the role of recent mergers. Our results highlight the importance of multi-probe analyses for accurately constraining cluster mass distributions and for refining simulation prescriptions that link observable properties to underlying dark matter and baryonic processes."

By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS 2155-304, we investigate correlations between flux changes and spectral shape across optical to X-ray bands over multiple epochs. High-cadence monitoring with coordinated multi-instrument campaigns has provided a homogeneous dataset, enabling detailed statistical treatment of variability amplitudes, timescales, and spectral slopes. Our analysis reveals pronounced flux-dependent hardening in the X-ray domain, consistent with synchrotron cooling and particle acceleration processes in a relativistic jet. Optical variability is comparatively slower and of lower amplitude, suggesting distinct emission zones or energy regimes for electrons contributing at different wavelengths. Cross-correlation functions between optical and X-ray light curves show time lags of several hours, hinting at stratification within the jet or energy-dependent acceleration efficiencies. We fit the time-resolved spectra with a log-parabolic synchrotron model, finding systematic evolution of curvature parameters during active states. These results support models involving episodic injection of high-energy particles and subsequent cooling, rather than steady-state emission. This work highlights the necessity of dense multi-band coverage to decode the non-linear variability patterns of BL Lac objects and to constrain physical conditions in their relativistic outflows."

The optical photometry revealed significant flux variations on timescales from hours to weeks, with correlated color changes indicating spectral hardening during flaring episodes. Radio observations showed moderate variability, suggesting the presence of long-lived emission regions within the jet. X-ray data obtained with *RXTE* provided evidence for a steep spectrum dominated by synchrotron emission, while upper limits in the γ-ray band constrained the location of the inverse Compton peak.

Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates ina spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on theother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b.

Aims: This motivates planet searches around stars which lie at the extremes of the stellar mass distribution, from low-mass M dwarfs to high-mass A and F-type stars, to reveal how disk characteristics and accretion processes shape planetary systems. Methods: We combine radial velocity monitoring, transit photometry, and high-resolution imaging from recent survey archives to quantify detection completeness and derive occurrence rates as a function of stellar mass. Bayesian inference is applied to model planet populations under core accretion and disk instability scenarios. Results: Our analysis shows a steep rise in giant-planet occurrence toward more massive stars, consistent with disk-mass scaling relations, while sub-Neptune planets dominate around low-mass hosts. The resulting trend in orbital architecture demonstrates that planetary migration efficiency varies systematically with the host’s gravitational potential and disk lifetime. Conclusions: These findings support a unified framework in which both the mass and thermal structure of the protoplanetary disk govern the diversity of planetary systems. Further progress requires high-precision observations of intermediate-mass stars to bridge the current gap between M-dwarf and A-star planets."

However, attempts to reconstructthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven moreproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, eitherduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced thefirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, commonenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massivewhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presentsinterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelopeevolution.

In this study, we present three-dimensional simulations of common envelope evolution using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve both the envelope ejection and the in-spiral dynamics. Our models explore a range of mass ratios, donor evolutionary states, and initial separations to quantify how envelope binding energy, recombination effects, and angular momentum redistribution influence the final orbital separation. We find that envelope removal efficiency depends strongly on the internal structure of the donor and the companion’s mass, with partial ejection occurring even in cases traditionally predicted to lead to full merger. By comparing synthetic light curves and remnant properties with observed transients, we constrain the conditions under which common envelope outcomes produce short-period binaries.

We find that the overall binary fraction of acluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at latetimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in thecentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a corebinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining).

We find that binary fractions evolve in a manner strongly dependent on the cluster’s initial relaxation time and central density. Clusters with high primordial binary fractions experience rapid dynamical processing, leading to disruption of soft binaries and an enhanced population of hard binaries in the core through mass segregation and exchange encounters. Conversely, clusters with low initial binary fractions show slower evolution, with binaries formed predominantly via three-body interactions. Core binary fractions can increase significantly over a few initial half-mass relaxation times, even when global fractions decline due to tidal stripping.

Within this framework, we analyze how parity-violating corrections arising from the Chern-Simons term modify the standard metric potentials and influence the motion of test particles. Starting from an effective action comprising the Einstein-Hilbert term and the dynamical Chern-Simons scalar coupled to the Pontryagin density, we derive the perturbed field equations around Minkowski spacetime. The perfect fluid is modeled by its rest-mass density, pressure, and four-velocity, allowing a consistent treatment of matter contributions up to the first post-Newtonian order. We identify corrections to the metric components that depend on spatial derivatives of the scalar field and quantify the resulting deviations from general relativity in the weak-field limit. These corrections alter the gravitational potentials and lead to modified equations of motion that could produce measurable effects in precision tests of gravity. We discuss the relevant parameter constraints and outline potential astrophysical and cosmological implications, including contributions to frame dragging and gravitational-wave propagation. This analysis provides a systematic route for extending post-Newtonian formalisms to parity-violating gravitational theories and guides future experimental searches for such effects."

By modeling the visibilities with radiative transfer simulations, we constrain both the cavity size and the location of any residual circumstellar and circumbinary material. Emission line diagnostics further reveal episodic accretion signatures that correlate with orbital phase, consistent with the periodic delivery of gas via transient streams penetrating the cavity. Our results indicate that, despite significant dynamical clearing, a non-negligible fraction of material crosses the gap, replenishing circumstellar disks on timescales shorter than the viscous evolution of the circumbinary disk. This accretion appears modulated by the binary eccentricity and mass ratio, offering insights into the role of gravitational torques in disk regulation.

K.; Maiti, B.), this work explores the predictive capacity of site-specific reactivity descriptors within diverse molecular frameworks, particularly focusing on organic and organometallic systems exhibiting multicenter bonding. Using density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations, we analyze local electrophilic and nucleophilic behavior through condensed Fukui functions and philicity indices, establishing robust correlations between computed local reactive trends and experimentally observed selectivity patterns. The study extends the classical global softness–hardness framework to include spatially resolved measures of electronic stability, offering insights into regioselectivity in substitution reactions and catalytic activity. Furthermore, reactivity patterns are quantitatively compared across different molecular environments to capture the influence of electronic delocalization and steric modulation. Our results demonstrate that local philicity serves as a reliable predictor of chemical reactivity, bridging conceptual DFT with empirical data and reaction mechanisms. The methodology presented herein provides a comprehensive approach for identifying reactive centers and optimizing molecular design for targeted reactivity, thereby enhancing theoretical understanding and practical applicability of quantum chemical reactivity descriptors."

Local nano-frictionexperiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine theevolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure forthe different lubricant formulations.

Using a combination of atomic force microscopy, nanoindentation, and in situ shear testing, the study reveals that ZDDP-derived films exhibit a stratified morphology composed of a dense phosphate-rich layer adjacent to the substrate and a less compact, amorphous overlayer. The formation kinetics and thickness of these layers depend strongly on the local temperature and contact stress history. Rheological measurements show that the films behave as viscoelastic solids, with a shear modulus that varies nonlinearly with strain rate, indicating a transition from elastic to plastic deformation regimes. These findings support a mechanochemical growth mechanism where surface reactions and stress-assisted diffusion jointly determine film properties. The interplay between layered structure and rheology provides new insight into how ZDDP additives mitigate wear while maintaining low friction, offering guidance for the design of environmentally compatible anti-wear formulations with optimized mechanical resilience and tribochemical performance."

Particular attention is given to the influence of collision models, equilibrium distribution functions, and boundary conditions on the accuracy and stability of fluid flow simulations. Using a systematic comparison between standard single-relaxation-time schemes and multi-relaxation-time formulations, we quantify their relative performance for benchmark problems involving incompressible and weakly compressible flows. Furthermore, we discuss how the lattice geometry and time discretization affect the isotropy of macroscopic quantities and the transport coefficients derived from the Chapman–Enskog expansion. The analysis demonstrates that careful calibration of relaxation parameters and grid resolution is vital for minimizing numerical artifacts and ensuring physical fidelity. These findings contribute to a more unified understanding of LB methods and provide practical guidelines for their robust application to complex flow systems, including multiphase and thermal regimes."

The resulting equation captures both relaxation and decoherence dynamics for arbitrary potential shapes and temperature regimes. Analytical rates are obtained for transitions between bound and free states, illustrating how surface phonons modify adsorption and desorption probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the sensitivity of transition rates to the phonon spectral density and to surface corrugation effects. Our formalism provides a unified framework applicable to cold atom–surface scattering, quantum reflection, and atom trapping near nanostructured materials.

Analysis of the oscillation damping and frequency shifts allows quantitative characterization of vortex viscosity and pinning energy landscapes.

Particular attention is paid to the radial component of the momentum operator, whose definition differs from the naïve substitution of derivatives and involves additional terms ensuring self-adjointness in the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on three-dimensional space. We also discuss the angular components, linking them directly to the generators of rotations and the orbital angular momentum operators. The resulting formalism is illustrated in the context of the hydrogen atom, where the spherical polar representation leads naturally to separable wave equations. This analysis highlights the pedagogical value of presenting the full coordinate-dependent structure of the momentum operator in foundational courses."

In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding toa ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames havebeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentrationprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after samplingwith a quartz microprobe.

The temperature was measured using aPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K.

The experimental study was carried out at low pressure using a flat-flame burner, with equivalence ratios chosen to emphasize fuel-rich oxidation pathways. Temperature profiles were measured with fine-wire thermocouples corrected for radiative losses, while stable and reactive intermediates were quantified using gas chromatography and molecular-beam mass spectrometry. The addition of unsaturated C₃ species (allene and propyne) led to notable changes in the concentration gradients of C₂ and C₃ intermediates, aromatic precursors, and soot-related species. Comparisons across the three flames indicate that dopants promote rapid formation of propargyl radicals and enhance pathways leading to benzene and higher aromatics, modifying both the onset and intensity of soot inception zones. These findings were supported by detailed kinetic modeling using updated reaction mechanisms, with simulations reproducing key experimental trends. The work provides new insight into chemical routes governing the transformation from small unsaturated hydrocarbons to aromatic and particulate matter in rich methane flames, contributing to improved predictive capabilities in combustion modeling and pollutant control strategies for advanced fuel formulations."

Our analysis uncovers a phase transition in the cumulant generating function associated with log-Laplace functionals, connecting the high temperature branch to critical branching Brownian motion through a suitable scaling limit. We further provide explicit asymptotic estimates for the eigenvalue gap of the linearized generator, yielding quantitative control on relaxation times and correlation decay.

Using a post-Newtonian framework supplemented by multipolar expansions, we derive expressions for the secular evolution of orbital parameters, including eccentricity and inclination, under the combined influence of relativistic gravitational wave emission and the quadrupole-induced precession. We find that the leading-order coupling between radiation reaction and the mass quadrupole produces measurable shifts in the orbital phase that accumulate over long timescales, potentially significant for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) around neutron stars or deformed black hole mimickers.

Key observables include rapidity distributions of net protons, total charged particle multiplicities, and momentum anisotropies, which together provide quantitative measures of stopping power. Simulations reveal that tip–tip collisions lead to enhanced longitudinal compression and greater baryon stopping compared to body–body interactions, due to higher initial longitudinal path lengths through nuclear matter. Conversely, body–body collisions exhibit broader transverse expansion and reduced net–baryon density at midrapidity.

Using analytic solutions and numerical simulations, we quantify this behavior through standard entanglement measures such as concurrence and von Neumann entropy. The results illustrate the sensitivity of bipartite entanglement to local unitary and nonunitary processes, revealing regimes where information can effectively “flow” through one qubit to influence global coherence. Beyond their pedagogical simplicity, these examples provide intuition for entanglement control protocols in open quantum systems and small-scale quantum devices.

A model in which thedust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperaturesaccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as amodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperaturesaccording to distance.

By fitting modified blackbody models to the measured flux densities, we infer dust temperatures of order 40 K and estimate a dust mass of a few × 10⁻⁴ M⊕, consistent with tenuous disks observed around other young late-type stars. The spatial resolution of the data does not resolve the disk, but the spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of grains extending to tens of AU from the star. These findings add to the growing evidence that low-mass pre-main sequence stars can retain significant reservoirs of cold dust well into ages of ~10 Myr, possibly supporting continued planetesimal formation or collisional evolution. The detection at both 850 and 450 μm provides crucial constraints on the long-wavelength slope of the emission, which in turn informs grain size distributions.

A key issue examined is thedetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is oftenempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrumfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering).

We follow up on an earliersuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling thedisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra canbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the colorcorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectrawith other models.

The impact of instrumental calibration and background modeling is also explored, as such systematics can rival statistical uncertainties. We highlight the necessity of incorporating multiwavelength constraints, time-domain variability, and physically motivated disk atmosphere models to break degeneracies. Comparative analysis of different relativistic reflection codes demonstrates the sensitivity of inferred parameters to modeling choices, underscoring the importance of transparent methodology and reproducibility in X-ray spectral analysis.

In the high-density regime, gravitational collapse proceeds rapidly in centrally concentrated clumps, yielding a top-heavy initial mass function driven by competitive accretion and mergers. As feedback intensifies, ionized bubbles and outflows disperse gas, quench further accretion onto massive cores, and fragment residual material into a swarm of lower-mass protostars. The transition is abrupt in parameter space, occurring over a narrow interval in initial gas column density, and is reproducible across varying magnetic field strengths and turbulence spectra. We identify a critical combination of free-fall time, feedback coupling efficiency, and cooling rate that governs this bifurcation in star formation modes.

Simulations for representative heavy systems such as \\(^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}+^{208}\\mathrm{Pb}\\) and \\(^{48}\\mathrm{Ca}+^{238}\\mathrm{U}\\) demonstrate that the timescale for charge equilibration is an order of magnitude shorter than that for deformation equilibration, consistent with recent experimental findings on quasifission observables. The results provide insight into the dynamical origin of fusion hindrance and help refine theoretical predictions for superheavy element synthesis. Our model establishes a bridge between macroscopic transport descriptions and microscopic mean‐field dynamics, offering a unified perspective on the equilibration process in strongly dissipative nuclear reactions."

We study different coding strategies inthe single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes.

We find that for a given route, thedecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperativecoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable bythe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperativecoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in termsof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithmruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm thatruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route whenthe nodes transmit independent codewords.

We study different coding strategies in the single-source single-relay scenario to understand how cooperation can enhance throughput and reliability under practical channel conditions. Specifically, we analyze decode-and-forward, compress-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward schemes in fading environments, focusing on their information-theoretic limits and achievable rate regions. The proposed analytical framework integrates both deterministic and stochastic channel models, providing insight into the tradeoffs among power consumption, latency, and spectral efficiency. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and illustrate the performance gains obtained through optimal relay placement and adaptive resource allocation. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to multi-relay configurations and discuss how relay selection and coordination policies influence network robustness. Our results demonstrate that cooperative strategies can significantly improve network capacity compared to traditional noncooperative systems, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. The findings suggest potential benefits for emerging wireless technologies such as 6G and Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, where decentralized cooperation among nodes can mitigate interference and improve coverage. Overall, this study offers a comprehensive perspective on designing efficient cooperative protocols to fully exploit the spatial diversity inherent in wireless relay networks."

The simple approximation is equivalent toan extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonizedby prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximationis capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. Thepair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence ofprey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time andanother displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the populationdensities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise througha Hopf bifurcation.

The individuals of each species are local agents that interact through stochastic rules representing reproduction, predation, and mortality at discrete time steps. Spatial heterogeneity and limited dispersal introduce nontrivial correlations that depart from classical mean-field approximations. By varying the transition probabilities, the model exhibits distinct dynamical regimes, including stable coexistence, predator extinction, and oscillatory population waves. Using Monte Carlo simulations combined with statistical analysis, we determine phase boundaries and quantify fluctuations around equilibrium densities. Finite-size scaling reveals that coexistence is sustained by noise-induced spatial patterns rather than deterministic cycles, emphasizing the role of local interactions in maintaining biodiversity. We further compare analytical approximations based on pair correlations and master-equation formulations to numerical results, demonstrating the accuracy limits of continuum descriptions for strongly stochastic lattices. The approach highlights how spatial stochasticity and local rules are sufficient to generate emergent order and critical transitions in ecological dynamics. Our findings contribute to the understanding of probabilistic cellular automata as minimal models for spatially extended ecological and population processes, bridging microscopic agent-based mechanisms with macroscopic statistical behavior."

We present a multiwavelength analysis of several confirmed and candidate IPs using recent X-ray and optical photometry, complemented by time-resolved spectroscopy. Our study applies Fourier analysis and phase-resolved spectral fitting to disentangle spin, beat, and orbital modulations, enabling precise determination of system geometries and magnetic field strengths. The results show significant variation in accretion mode among sources, ranging from disk-fed configurations to diskless, stream-fed regimes, with transitions potentially driven by changes in mass-transfer rate. X-ray spectra exhibit multi-temperature optically thin emission consistent with shock-heated plasma, alongside complex absorption structures indicative of partial covering by the accretion curtains. We discuss implications for angular momentum evolution, magnetic field decay, and the role of IPs as progenitors of synchronized polars.

The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allowsus to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperaturestructure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot coretemperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatialdifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhancedat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperaturesensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. TheSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from thishot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hotcore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons forthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the mainsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to thelarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of thecentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk.

Comparison with chemical models supports a scenario in which heating from the nascent massive protostar initiates rapid chemical evolution on timescales of 10⁴–10⁵ years.

Employing exact diagonalization and variational cluster methods, we demonstrate that geometric frustration stabilizes charge-ordered ground states with degenerate configurations connected by local rearrangements. The resulting domain-wall excitations carry fractionalized charge due to the discrete nature of the order parameter and constraints from the lattice tiling rules. We map the low-energy dynamics of these excitations to an emergent lattice gauge theory, where fractional charges correspond to gauge flux defects. Our results reveal characteristic signatures in the single-particle spectral function and density-density correlations, suggesting that fractionalization can be probed via spectroscopic techniques in cold-atom optical lattice emulators and potentially in frustrated electronic materials. The work establishes a microscopic mechanism for fractional charge in two-dimensional frustrated fermion systems, bridging concepts from fractional quantum Hall physics and strongly correlated lattice models."

This paper introduces the notion of \"canonicalnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacitiescan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that thethroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upperbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are manyhops away.

Our simulations show that 802.11 networks withrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs farbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near thegateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) tofashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can beimproved significantly by more than 150%.

Using a combination of analytical modeling, simulation, and experimental validation, we derive asymptotic bounds on end-to-end throughput as a function of network size, topology, and medium access control parameters. The analysis reveals that spatial reuse and collision avoidance jointly determine capacity scaling, with the central node’s contention domain acting as the primary bottleneck.

Our results demonstrate that optimizing channel access fairness and employing adaptive routing substantially improve throughput compared to baseline IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination mechanisms.
