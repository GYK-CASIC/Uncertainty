Here we exploredifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory andthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derivethe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theoryand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit.

    "ai_generated_text": "A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation, has gained some attention in recent years due to its relevance in loop quantum gravity and related approaches to quantum cosmology. Unlike the standard Schrödinger representation, the polymer framework is characterized by a discrete structure in configuration space, leading to profound modifications in the spectral properties of operators and in the dynamics of quantum systems. This non-separable Hilbert space representation introduces a fundamental length scale, thereby breaking the continuity of momentum space and altering the usual Heisenberg uncertainty relations. In this work, we review the mathematical underpinnings of the polymer representation, emphasizing its construction via the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal formalism and its inequivalence to the standard representation according to the Stone–von Neumann theorem. We explore applications to simple systems such as the harmonic oscillator and free particle, highlighting deviations from conventional energy spectra and wavefunction behavior. Possible physical implications are discussed, particularly in contexts where quantum gravitational effects become significant. Our analysis suggests that the polymer representation may provide a useful effective model for probing Planck-scale phenomena while remaining consistent with known low-energy physics."

We then discussthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 suchobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. Anadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identifiedfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets ofresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties withthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modelingof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objectsexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit withactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possiblydebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extendsdown to at least a few x.001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's fromextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's aremore highly clustered than the later stages and that the backgroundextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation functionas seen in other extra-galactic studies.

Using multi-band photometry from 3.6 to 70 μm, we construct spectral energy distributions to classify sources into Class 0/I, Class II, and Class III, enabling a detailed census of the embedded population. Our analysis reveals a high surface density of protostars in the central cluster, with evidence for spatial substructure likely linked to ongoing fragmentation. The combination of IRAC’s sensitivity to mid-infrared excesses and MIPS’s capability to detect cooler dust emission allows us to probe both the warm inner disks and the colder envelope material. We find that the Class I population is concentrated in regions of high extinction, consistent with active accretion and envelope infall, while Class II sources are more widely distributed. The derived luminosity function suggests a range of accretion rates and possible episodic accretion events. Comparison with ancillary millimeter and extinction maps supports a scenario in which star formation in Serpens is both clustered and sequential, with younger sources tracing the densest gas. These results provide constraints on timescales and environmental influences in clustered star formation."

Spin-modulated radialvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the firsttime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed thetheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) andNorton et al.

Evidencefor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya ispresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta andhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at theouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow ofmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) andclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with theaccretion curtain model.",

Spin-modulated variations in emission line profiles and continuum flux are analyzed to investigate accretion geometry and magnetically channeled flow structures. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals periodic changes consistent with the white dwarf’s spin period, indicating contributions from both the accretion curtains and the heated magnetic poles. The Balmer and He II emission lines display asymmetric velocity components, suggesting a combination of disc-fed and stream-fed accretion. Radial velocity measurements show evidence for emission originating near the magnetospheric radius, with modulation amplitudes varying between the two epochs. Comparison of 1991 and 2001 datasets suggests a modest change in mass transfer rate, inferred from line strength ratios and continuum slope variations. The absence of strong outburst signatures confirms the system was in a low accretion state during both campaigns. These results support a hybrid accretion model for EX Hya, where material from the truncated disc is funneled along magnetic field lines toward the poles, producing the observed line variability. Long-term changes in spin-modulated profiles may reflect evolution of the inner disc radius and magnetic coupling efficiency, underscoring the diagnostic power of phase-resolved spectroscopy in IP systems."

In this work, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the steady-state and transient responses of multisite cycles under conditions of enzyme saturation, competitive binding, and stochastic fluctuations. Using both deterministic models and stochastic simulations, we identify regimes where multisite modification acts as a tunable switch, a graded amplifier, or a bistable element. Furthermore, we explore how asymmetry in phosphorylation versus dephosphorylation kinetics can lead to ultrasensitivity or hysteresis, thereby enhancing robustness to noise and enabling memory effects in signaling networks. Our results suggest that the architectural flexibility of multisite cycles allows cells to repurpose the same underlying motif for diverse functional outcomes. This quantitative characterization provides insights into how subtle changes in enzyme activity or site accessibility can modulate signaling responses, with implications for synthetic biology and therapeutic targeting of dysregulated pathways."

Special attention is given to the choice of dipole spacing, lattice geometry, and iterative solver performance for large-scale problems.

A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component.

We introduce and investigate globally defined geometric structures arising from specific curvature and torsion constraints within the broader class of Finsler spaces. Our approach emphasizes coordinate-free formulations, enabling a unified treatment of local and global properties. We first recall fundamental notions of Finsler geometry, including the Chern connection, geodesic spray, and curvature tensors, then specialize to classes characterized by symmetries of the Cartan tensor and restrictions on flag curvature. Particular attention is given to manifolds admitting parallelizable distributions compatible with the Finsler metric, as these yield simplified holonomy groups and tractable global invariants. We establish existence theorems for certain special Finsler structures under topological constraints, and we analyze their stability under smooth deformations. Several examples are constructed on compact and non-compact manifolds, illustrating how local metric conditions extend to global geometric behavior. Finally, we discuss applications to variational problems, including generalized geodesics and energy functionals, and outline potential connections to theoretical physics, where Finsler-like geometries model anisotropic spacetimes. This work aims to consolidate scattered results into a coherent framework, facilitating further research in the global theory of special Finsler manifolds."

The bonding in the potassium–graphite compound is characterized by a predominantly ionic interaction, with potassium atoms donating valence electrons to the graphene layers, resulting in charge transfer that modifies the electronic structure of the host lattice. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the intercalated potassium resides between graphene sheets, expanding the interlayer spacing and inducing notable changes in the band dispersion near the Fermi level. The formation energies indicate that intercalation is energetically favorable over a range of potassium concentrations, with stability enhanced by the periodic arrangement of potassium layers. Analysis of the charge density distribution and Bader charge partitioning confirms substantial electron transfer from potassium to carbon, leading to enhanced conductivity and modified density of states. The calculated phonon spectra demonstrate dynamical stability of the intercalated structures, while elastic constant evaluation indicates reduced in-plane stiffness compared to pristine graphite. These results provide microscopic insight into the interplay between ionic bonding and structural modification in potassium–graphite intercalation compounds, with implications for their use in energy storage, superconductivity, and nanoelectronic applications.

We demonstrate this by analyzing linearized and perturbative expansions for scalar, vector, and tensor fields in arbitrary dimensions, showing that their effective light-cone Hamiltonians share a common structural form. The result has implications for both classical and quantum regimes, including string theory quantization in pp-wave limits, gauge/gravity duality in highly boosted sectors, and the stability analysis of gravitational wave solutions. The universality property thus provides a unifying framework for understanding diverse covariant theories in backgrounds that interpolate between flat space and more general curved geometries while retaining exact solvability features."

Artificial opal photonic crystals, infiltrated with various dopants, were investigated under pulsed laser excitation to explore nonlinear optical phenomena and transient emission behavior. Measurements were conducted across a broad spectral range, capturing both prompt and delayed luminescence components. The energetics of the emission process were analyzed in relation to excitation pulse parameters, revealing threshold-like behavior and distinct regimes of radiative output. Temporal profiling using fast photodetectors demonstrated multi-scale decay dynamics, suggesting the coexistence of rapid photonic crystal–mediated scattering processes and slower recombination channels influenced by defect states. Spectral analysis indicated significant reshaping of the emission profile, with evidence of bandgap-related modulation and possible stimulated components. Comparative experiments with undoped opals confirmed that dopant-induced states contribute to both spectral broadening and enhanced emission intensity. The interplay between the photonic band structure and embedded active centers is discussed in the context of energy transfer, light localization, and emission control. These findings contribute to the understanding of light–matter interactions in structured dielectric media and highlight potential applications in tunable light sources, optical sensing, and photonic devices."

By adapting the timing formalism, originally developed for the Milky Way–Andromeda system, to the much larger mass and higher velocity regime of the Bullet Cluster, we derive bounds on the total gravitational mass required to reproduce the current dynamical state. The analysis incorporates observational uncertainties in projected separation, inclination, and shock velocity, as well as a range of plausible cosmological parameters. We find that the inferred mass significantly exceeds the visible baryonic content, implying a dominant dark matter component regardless of the assumed orbit orientation or initial conditions.

Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration).

The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability density functions are employed to characterize the statistical relationship between the measured variables. The methodology assumes that experimental observations are subject to noise and finite sampling effects, and it leverages nonparametric estimation techniques to recover the underlying deterministic law embedded in the data. By analyzing the joint distribution, one can infer the functional form of y₀(x) as the expectation of y conditioned on x, while the marginal distributions provide insight into the variability and measurement spread of each variable separately. The conditional density function is used to quantify the uncertainty around the predicted values, enabling the construction of confidence intervals for the inferred law. The approach is demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets, showing robustness to measurement errors and applicability across diverse physical contexts. This probabilistic framework integrates statistical inference with physical modeling, offering a systematic pathway from raw experimental measurements to explicit functional relationships, and thereby supporting both model validation and the discovery of new laws in experimental sciences."

The method integrates precomputed molecular data, adaptive gridding in parameter space, and parallelized likelihood evaluation, allowing the simultaneous fitting of tens to hundreds of transitions from different species. Application to synthetic and archival datasets demonstrates that the approach recovers key physical parameters within uncertainties comparable to full-scale Monte Carlo simulations, but at a fraction of the computational cost. We discuss extensions to handle blended lines, spatially resolved observations, and multi-phase media, highlighting the potential for real-time analysis of upcoming survey data from facilities such as ALMA, JWST, and the ngVLA. This framework thus provides a pathway to fully exploit the information content of modern spectroscopic observations in the era of big data astrophysics."

At low temperatures, the nanotubes exhibit minimal atomic displacement and retain near-perfect cylindrical geometry, while increasing temperature induces progressive lattice distortion and reduction in mechanical stiffness. The simulations reveal a nonlinear degradation in elastic modulus above 800 K, accompanied by onset of irreversible structural changes. Thermal energy promotes anharmonic vibrations, leading to local bond stretching and eventual bond breakage near critical thresholds. The results highlight a transition regime where structural integrity is compromised before complete fracture, which is relevant for high-temperature applications of carbon nanotube-reinforced composites and nanoelectromechanical systems.

    "ai_generated_text": "We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star cluster. Our Spitzer census, supplemented by ground-based spectra, has enabled a comprehensive characterization of the young stellar population and their circumstellar environments. Using IRAC and MIPS imaging, we identify sources with infrared excesses indicative of protoplanetary disks and classify them into evolutionary stages from Class 0/I protostars to Class III diskless pre–main-sequence stars. The mid-infrared photometry is combined with optical and near-infrared spectroscopy to determine spectral types, effective temperatures, and extinction values, allowing precise placement of members on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. This approach reveals a broad age spread within the cluster, suggesting a prolonged star formation history over several Myr. Spatially, we detect a concentration of the youngest protostars in filamentary structures coincident with dense molecular gas, while more evolved members are distributed throughout the cluster core and halo. The disk fraction shows a radial dependence, decreasing with distance from active star-forming regions. Our census increases the known membership by over 30%, including several new substellar candidates. These results provide an updated benchmark for studies of disk evolution, star formation efficiency, and environmental effects within intermediate-age clusters in the Perseus molecular cloud complex."

We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest.

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subclusterwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions ofthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionlessgalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on theself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, usingsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, andcomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow fora new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observationof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. Thisnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. Ifwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equalmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringentconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of thesubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with theuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of darkmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slightimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules outmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between thestandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.",

Our analysis synthesizes multi-wavelength datasets from Chandra, XMM-Newton, HST, and ground-based spectroscopic surveys with high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations incorporating dark matter, gas physics, and feedback processes. By cross-correlating projected mass maps from lensing with X-ray-derived temperature and density profiles, we quantify deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium and assess the impact of non-thermal pressure support. Optical spectroscopy constrains velocity dispersions and substructure, enabling tests of merger histories inferred from simulations. We find good agreement between simulated and observed scaling relations for relaxed clusters, but significant discrepancies in disturbed systems, particularly in core entropy profiles and lensing mass concentrations. These differences highlight the role of complex baryonic physics and anisotropic accretion, which remain challenging to model. Our results underscore the necessity of combining complementary observational probes with state-of-the-art simulations to disentangle the interplay between dark matter and baryons, improve cluster mass calibration, and refine their use as cosmological tools. We discuss implications for future surveys and simulation strategies aimed at resolving current tensions."

Our dataset combines high-cadence optical–UV photometry, X-ray spectra from space-based observatories, and contemporaneous TeV γ-ray measurements, enabling a coherent analysis over more than three decades in photon energy. We apply time-resolved spectral fitting to quantify changes in peak frequencies, spectral slopes, and curvature parameters, and we correlate these with variability timescales inferred from light-curve analysis. The results reveal pronounced spectral hardening during high-flux states, consistent with rapid particle acceleration episodes in a relativistic jet, followed by cooling-dominated softening phases. Cross-band correlations suggest a co-spatial origin for synchrotron and high-energy components, while deviations during extreme flares point to multi-zone emission scenarios. This comprehensive temporal–spectral study strengthens constraints on leptonic jet models and highlights the need for coordinated multi-instrument campaigns to capture the full complexity of BL Lac variability.

The optical light curve exhibited pronounced variability on timescales of days to weeks, correlated with changes in the X-ray flux, suggesting a common origin in a relativistic jet.

Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates ina spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on theother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detectionadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, andreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populatedthan the jovian mass range.

Our dataset comprises multi‑year monitoring of 45 targets, enabling sensitivity to planets with orbital periods from a few days to several years. We employ Bayesian periodogram analysis to identify significant periodic signals and Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling to constrain orbital parameters. Results: We report the detection of several Neptune‑mass candidates and one Saturn‑mass planet in temperate orbits, with minimum masses and semi‑major axes consistent with predictions from core‑accretion models for low‑mass stars. The frequency of giant planets appears markedly reduced compared to solar‑type hosts, while sub‑Neptune planets are relatively common. Conclusions: These findings support the trend that stellar mass influences both the occurrence rate and characteristic mass scale of planets.

The mapping campaign covered a rectangular area approximately 20′ × 20′, enabling us to resolve substructure in both absorption against the cosmic microwave background and localized emission features. The H$_2$CO line profiles reveal multiple velocity components, indicative of complex kinematics possibly linked to ongoing star formation activity.

Our models incorporate realistic stellar profiles from 1D stellar evolution codes mapped into adaptive mesh refinement grids, enabling resolution of both large-scale envelope flows and the vicinity of the embedded companion. We analyze energy and angular momentum transfer, the efficiency of envelope ejection, and the final separations of the surviving cores. The simulations reveal that envelope unbinding is highly sensitive to the initial binding energy and to the degree of asymmetric outflows generated during inspiral.

The simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, two-body relaxation, and dynamical interactions over several gigayears, enabling us to track both the global and radial trends in binary fractions. We find that in clusters with high initial binary content, dynamical disruption of soft pairs is significant in the early phases, leading to a rapid decrease in the binary fraction in the outer regions. Conversely, hard binaries are preserved and tend to migrate toward the core via mass segregation, increasing the central binary fraction over time. Clusters with low initial binary fractions exhibit slower evolution but still develop pronounced radial gradients due to differential dynamical processing.

Based on this simulation, we suggest that the centralregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of aslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by acentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant thatmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamicstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellarevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled byneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, andthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effectiveaccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretionof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of doubleCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply thatat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered goodcandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, thecharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventualexplosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).",

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 M⊙ primary and a 0.6 M⊙ secondary is followed using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with a realistic equation of state and nuclear reaction network. We investigate the onset of mass transfer, tidal disruption of the secondary, and the formation of an accretion disk around the primary. The simulations track both the thermodynamic and kinematic properties of the merger remnant over several dynamical timescales, revealing the development of hot, dense regions in the shear interface. We analyze the conditions under which carbon ignition occurs, assessing whether the merger leads to a prompt detonation, a delayed central ignition, or a stable remnant. Angular momentum redistribution, viscous heating, and cooling processes are examined to understand the long-term evolution toward either a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf or collapse to a neutron star. Our results highlight the sensitivity of the outcome to the initial mass ratio, orbital configuration, and thermal history of the components. This study provides constraints on the progenitor scenarios for Type Ia supernovae and sheds light on the fate of massive CO white dwarf mergers in binary stellar evolution."

This paper revisits the theoretical properties of single-index estimators under modern data regimes characterized by large \\(p\\) and potentially complex dependence structures. We develop a unified estimation procedure that integrates sparsity-inducing regularization with smooth function estimation, allowing for both variable selection and nonlinear effect modeling. The asymptotic behavior of the proposed estimator is established under mild regularity conditions, and we derive convergence rates that adapt to the unknown smoothness of the link function. Simulation studies demonstrate that the method achieves robust performance in terms of prediction accuracy and index recovery, even under noisy, correlated predictors. Applications to real-world datasets, including economic forecasting and genomic signal extraction, illustrate the practical utility of the approach.

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the directmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, forboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes itstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-typegalaxies alike.

Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, andintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the localmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-typegalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}.

The analysis incorporates contributions from both s-wave and p-wave pion–nucleon interactions, and includes effects of the nuclear polarization induced by the Fermi seas of protons and neutrons. We find that in ANM the degeneracy between π⁺, π⁰, and π⁻ modes is lifted, leading to distinct energy shifts that grow with increasing asymmetry parameter. The p-wave coupling to particle–hole and Δ–hole excitations further modifies the momentum dependence of the modes, resulting in possible softening of specific pion branches.

In this companion paper, the principle ofconservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value ofar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely onkey cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitationalconstant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law ofgravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary betweena four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking thespeed of light to the mass of the Universe.",
    "ai_generated_text": "The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors. In the present work, we extend that analysis by examining the theoretical consequences for the stability and evolution of gravitationally bound systems under this modified framework. The additional dimension is treated as orthogonal to the conventional four-dimensional continuum, with its influence manifesting through altered geodesic trajectories and modified gravitational potentials. Using a perturbative approach, we derive corrections to classical orbital parameters, including eccentricity, precession rates, and energy distributions, for both two-body and many-body configurations. Numerical simulations are employed to explore the parameter space and to identify regimes in which the fifth-dimensional effects are significant relative to observational uncertainties. Potential astrophysical implications are discussed, with particular attention to long-period planetary systems and wide binary stars, where deviations from Newtonian and relativistic predictions might be detectable. The results suggest that even a weak coupling to the extra dimension can lead to measurable anomalies over cosmological timescales, providing a possible avenue for empirical tests. This framework offers a novel perspective on orbital mechanics and motivates further investigation into higher-dimensional gravitational models."

Employing a combination of conceptual DFT indices—such as chemical potential, hardness, and Fukui functions—we map local philicity values for a set of representative organic and organometallic species. Computational results reveal that local philicity not only correlates strongly with experimentally observed reaction centers but also captures subtle substituent and conformational effects that global indices overlook. We further demonstrate that this approach can rationalize regioselectivity trends in electrophilic aromatic substitution and nucleophilic addition reactions, providing a quantitative framework for reactivity interpretation. The integration of local philicity mapping with molecular electrostatic potential analysis enhances predictive power for site-selective functionalization.

The films exhibit a stratified architecture, with a dense, phosphate-rich basal layer supporting a more compliant, zinc- and sulfur-containing overlayer. Rheological measurements under varying temperature and shear conditions reveal that the viscoelastic response of the films is highly dependent on both the applied load history and the local chemical composition. These findings suggest that the anti-wear performance of ZDDP-derived films arises from a synergistic balance between mechanical stiffness at the interface and the ability to undergo controlled shear in the upper layers, thereby dissipating energy and preventing substrate damage. The results provide new insights into the nanoscale structure–property relationships governing tribofilm behavior, offering guidance for the design of next-generation lubricant additives with improved durability and reduced environmental impact.

Numerical calculations for the transition rates areperformed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number ofbound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rateis shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deepbound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders ofmagnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.We also study various types of transitions from free states.

We present a general master equation governing the dynamics of the atomic motional state under coupling to thermal vibrations of the substrate. The formulation incorporates both absorption and emission processes arising from the exchange of energy quanta with the phonon bath, and is derived within the Born–Markov approximation for weak system–bath coupling. The potential landscape is treated in full generality, allowing for arbitrary corrugation and confinement geometries, and the phonon spectral density is left as an input to capture material-specific properties. We identify transition rates between discrete translational levels in terms of overlap integrals of atomic wavefunctions and phonon mode displacements, providing a unified description valid for both bound and quasi-free surface states. The resulting master equation enables prediction of relaxation times, steady-state distributions, and decoherence rates, and naturally reduces to familiar rate equations in the limit of negligible coherences. As an application, we consider a harmonically confined atom near a crystalline substrate, illustrating how phonon dispersion and temperature influence the level populations. Our approach is relevant for interpreting experiments in atom–surface scattering, adsorption dynamics, and quantum control of surface-bound atoms."

Visible spectra (0.4–0.9 µm) were obtained at moderate resolution, complemented by broadband BVRI photometry to constrain spectral slopes and colors. Our analysis reveals a predominance of featureless, moderately red spectra consistent with D-type taxonomic classification, though several members of specific families exhibit less-red slopes typical of P-type asteroids. Color distributions appear correlated with family membership, suggesting possible compositional homogeneity within certain clusters.

Polarized reflectivity spectra were obtained over a broad temperature interval spanning both the metallic and insulating regimes, enabling a detailed characterization of the evolution of the low-energy electrodynamics. In the metallic phase, the data reveal a pronounced Drude-like component indicative of coherent charge transport along the chain direction, superimposed on a set of sharp vibrational features arising from both intra- and intermolecular modes. Upon cooling through the metal–insulator transition, we observe the progressive suppression of the Drude weight and the emergence of a well-defined optical gap, accompanied by enhanced intensity and narrowing of certain phonon lines, consistent with the onset of long-range ordering. Analysis using Kramers–Kronig transformations yields the complex conductivity, from which we extract temperature-dependent parameters for the charge dynamics.

Consequently one always generalizes theCartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap. In this workwe introduce the difficulties one faces when the question of the momentumoperator in spherical polar coordinate comes. We have tried to point out mostof the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,which has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentumexpectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation valuereally turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentumexpectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angularvariables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them asdynamical variables.

This omission can lead to confusion when addressing problems with inherent spherical symmetry, such as the hydrogen atom or scattering processes. In spherical coordinates, the canonical momentum components are not simply obtained by substituting variables; instead, they emerge from the requirement that the operators be Hermitian under the appropriate integration measure. Starting from the Cartesian representation and applying the coordinate transformation, one must account for the Jacobian of the transformation and the curvature of the coordinate system. The radial momentum operator, for example, acquires a derivative term weighted by the radial coordinate, while angular components involve derivatives with respect to the polar and azimuthal angles, coupled with trigonometric factors. We review the derivation of these operators explicitly, emphasizing the subtleties associated with operator ordering and domain of definition. Applications to central potentials illustrate the utility of the spherical form, particularly in separation of variables for the Schrödinger equation. This discussion clarifies the geometric origin of momentum operators in curvilinear coordinates and underscores their importance in both pedagogical and research contexts."

The comparison between the undoped and doped flames reveals the influence of C₃ hydrocarbon additives on reaction pathways, particularly in the formation and consumption of small unsaturated species such as acetylene, ethylene, and propyne. The presence of allene and propyne significantly enhances the production of aromatic precursors, notably benzene, through pathways involving propargyl radical recombination. Temperature profiles indicate modest shifts in peak temperature positions with doping, reflecting altered heat release patterns due to modified oxidation chemistry. The experimental results are complemented by kinetic modeling using an updated reaction mechanism, which reproduces the main trends in species distributions and identifies key reactions controlling aromatic growth.

In the high temperature phase, the effective diffusivity is large, leading to rapid spatial mixing and attenuated clustering. We derive asymptotic moment formulas and refine large-deviation estimates for the empirical type distribution, highlighting how the interplay between type dynamics and spatial dispersion governs macroscopic observables. Using spectral methods for the underlying type-transition generator and perturbative expansions in the branching rate, we identify critical thresholds separating diffusive and superdiffusive regimes. Our results clarify the nature of the extremal particle cloud, showing that in the high temperature limit the spatial front advances linearly in time with Gaussian fluctuations, while type correlations decay exponentially.

We model the spacetime as a small quadrupolar perturbation of the Schwarzschild metric and compute the leading-order gravitational wave energy and angular momentum fluxes using post-Newtonian techniques. The resulting coupled evolution equations for the semimajor axis, eccentricity, and orbital inclination reveal that the quadrupole moment induces precession of the orbital plane and shifts in the periastron advance rate, which in turn modulate the radiation reaction-driven inspiral.

    "ai_generated_text": "This paper extends and builds upon the results of an earlier paper, in which we described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform geometrical configurations in order to realize specific gauge theory structures in string and M-theory compactifications. Here, we generalize those methods to a broader class of singularities, focusing on controlled deformations that preserve supersymmetry while inducing targeted changes in the low-energy effective theory. By systematically classifying admissible deformations within the framework of toric geometry and ALE fibration techniques, we provide explicit criteria for engineering both rank-preserving and rank-reducing transitions. We further analyze the moduli space structure associated with these deformations, highlighting the interplay between complex structure parameters and gauge symmetry breaking patterns. Several illustrative examples are presented, including novel constructions that yield chiral matter spectra via topological transitions. Our approach unifies existing deformation schemes under a single geometric formalism and clarifies the correspondence between singularity resolution, physical couplings, and vacuum structure. These results not only extend the toolkit for model building in higher-dimensional theories but also offer new insights into the global constraints and phenomenological potentials of string-derived gauge sectors. Possible applications to F-theory GUT models and heterotic duals are briefly discussed."

The data reveal numerous narrow absorption and emission features superimposed on the continuum, including lines from highly ionized species such as Fe XXV, Fe XXVI, Si XIV, and Mg XII.

One of the central themes is the counterintuitive nature of local operations in composite quantum systems, particularly when non-unitary processes such as measurements or dissipation are involved. We present a set of minimal models in which a single-qubit interaction — modeled either as a unitary rotation coupled to an ancilla or as an amplitude damping channel — leads to a non-monotonic change in the entanglement between the target qubit and its remote partner. The examples are chosen to be analytically tractable, allowing explicit computation of concurrence and von Neumann entropy throughout the evolution. By varying control parameters, such as interaction strength or decoherence rate, one can observe regimes where entanglement is enhanced via coherent local dynamics, and regimes where it is degraded due to loss of coherence. These results illustrate that local interventions, even without direct coupling to the second qubit, can redistribute quantum correlations in nontrivial ways. The simplicity of the models makes them suitable for pedagogical demonstrations as well as for benchmarking experimental control in small quantum registers.

A model in which thedust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperaturesaccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as amodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperaturesaccording to distance.

The measured flux densities indicate the presence of a substantial dust component, consistent with a debris disk or remnant protoplanetary material. By modeling the spectral energy distribution with modified blackbody fits, we constrain the dust temperature to be in the range 40–60 K and estimate a total dust mass of order a few lunar masses, depending on assumed grain properties.

A key issue examined is thedetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is oftenempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrumfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot bepre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretionrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earliersuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling thedisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering.

The role of time variability and spectral state transitions is emphasized, as these phenomena alter the relative contributions of thermal and Comptonized components, potentially mimicking changes in accretion geometry.

In the low rigidity regime, thermal fluctuations induce extended tubular conformations with quasi-one-dimensional symmetry. At intermediate rigidity, the system exhibits a planar phase characterized by large-scale flattening and suppression of curvature fluctuations. In the high rigidity regime, the surface minimizes its bending energy by forming nearly perfect spheres. We quantify these phases by measuring the radius of gyration, asphericity, and correlation functions of the triangulated mesh. Transitions between phases are found to be continuous or weakly first-order, depending on control parameters, and are accompanied by significant changes in topological rearrangements of the triangulation. Our results provide insight into the phase behavior of fluid membranes and may have applications in understanding biological vesicles, synthetic capsules, and soft matter systems with tunable mechanical properties."

The superconductor contains percolating pathways of superconducting material interspersed with inclusions of normal-phase regions whose boundaries exhibit fractal geometry. Such morphology strongly influences the pinning landscape experienced by magnetic vortices. We develop a theoretical framework that accounts for the statistical distribution of cluster sizes and their fractal dimensionality, linking these parameters to the depinning threshold and flux-flow resistivity. The fractal boundaries enhance pinning efficiency by increasing the effective interface length between superconducting and normal regions, thereby modifying the critical current in a nontrivial way. Numerical simulations of vortex motion through model percolative lattices reveal that transport properties are governed by a combination of percolation connectivity and fractal pinning strength, leading to anomalous scaling of the current–voltage characteristics near the percolation threshold. The results suggest that tuning the fractal dimension of normal-phase clusters offers a potential route to optimizing vortex immobilization without significantly reducing the superconducting volume fraction. This study provides insight into the interplay between microstructural complexity and vortex dynamics, with implications for the design of composite superconductors with tailored transport and stability properties."

    "ai_generated_text": "We present the first systematic investigation of the [Ne V] (14 µm/24 µm) and [S III] (18 µm/33 µm) mid-infrared line ratios across a diverse sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies observed with *Spitzer* and *JWST*. These high-ionization fine-structure transitions are sensitive to electron density, ionization state, and dust extinction, providing key diagnostics of narrow-line region (NLR) conditions. Our sample spans a wide range of bolometric luminosities, host morphologies, and obscuration levels, enabling a robust analysis of the impact of AGN activity on ionized gas properties. We perform uniform spectral extraction and careful continuum subtraction to minimize systematic uncertainties, and compare the observed ratios with predictions from photoionization models incorporating varying densities, ionization parameters, and grain compositions. We find that [Ne V] ratios in AGN typically indicate subcritical densities and minimal extinction, whereas [S III] ratios in star-forming regions suggest higher densities and stronger dust effects. A subset of composite systems shows anomalously low [Ne V] ratios, consistent with either density stratification or differential extinction between the 14 µm and 24 µm lines. Our results refine the use of these ratios as diagnostics of NLR physics, and highlight the importance of mid-IR spectroscopy for disentangling AGN-driven ionization from stellar processes in dusty environments."
