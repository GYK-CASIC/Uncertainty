    "ai_generated_text": "A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has gained some attention in recent years due to its deep connection with background-independent approaches to quantum gravity. In this framework, the continuum structure of standard Hilbert spaces is replaced by a discrete topology inspired by loop quantization techniques, leading to modifications in the spectral properties of operators such as momentum and position. This work provides a systematic analysis of the mathematical foundations underlying polymer quantization and explores its physical implications for simple mechanical models including harmonic oscillators and free particles. By examining how observables emerge through suitable shadow states and effective descriptions, we clarify both its relation to standard Schrödinger quantization and the regime where measurable departures from conventional predictions may arise. Extensions toward field-theoretic constructions are discussed, highlighting potential applications in cosmological scenarios where discreteness effects become significant near Planckian scales. Our results emphasize that although polymer representations lead to unconventional operator algebras, they remain consistent with key principles of quantum mechanics while offering a robust platform for exploring non-perturbative phenomena beyond ordinary continuous frameworks."

Anadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identifiedfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets ofresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties withthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modelingof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objectsexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit withactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possiblydebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extendsdown to at least a few x.001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's fromextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's aremore highly clustered than the later stages and that the backgroundextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation functionas seen in other extra-galactic studies.

The multi-wavelength dataset, covering 3.6–70 μm, enables the identification and classification of over several hundred sources based on spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning Class 0/I protostars through Class III pre-main-sequence stars. By combining photometric measurements with spatial distribution analysis, we examine clustering properties, evolutionary stage fractions, and correlations between source location and local extinction. The results reveal compact groupings of deeply embedded protostars within high column density cores as well as more dispersed populations at later evolutionary stages. Color–color diagnostics from IRAC channels highlight strong infrared excess in early-stage objects, while MIPS data uncover substantial emission from cold circumstellar material. Comparative analysis with other c2d regions suggests that Serpens exhibits a higher fraction of very young sources than average, consistent with an ongoing active episode of star formation triggered by local gas dynamics or feedback processes. These findings advance our understanding of how environmental conditions shape stellar birth within molecular clouds and provide a foundation for future high-resolution follow-up studies targeting individual protoclusters in Serpens."

These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed thetheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) andNorton et al.

Evidencefor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,confirming the result of Belle et al.

Spin-modulated variations are detected across optical emission lines, confirming accretion onto magnetic poles through a truncated disk. The analysis reveals that Balmer and He II line profiles display distinct spin-resolved behavior, with pronounced velocity shifts synchronized to the white dwarf’s rotation. Doppler tomography indicates a stable accretion geometry over the decade, with persistent evidence for magnetically controlled curtain flows connecting the inner disk edge to the magnetic poles. Comparison between epochs shows modest changes in emission strength consistent with variable mass transfer rates but no significant alteration in systemic velocity or orbital modulation. Radial-velocity curves suggest that material approaches free-fall velocities near magnitudes consistent with previously determined magnetic field strengths of a few megagauss. A combined fit to photometric and spectroscopic modulations constrains the inclination at approximately 78°, supporting prior analyses derived from eclipse mapping studies. These quiescent-state spectra hence provide one of the longest baselines for monitoring an intermediate polar’s stability, illustrating how EX Hya maintains a dynamically steady yet magnetically complex accretion environment under low-luminosity conditions characteristic of its recurrent cycle."

We derive strong and weak convergence results under appropriate regularity conditions, emphasizing the role of commutator relations between deterministic and stochastic vector fields in achieving higher-order accuracy. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of our methods for problems arising in rigid body dynamics with noise perturbations, stochastic flows on matrix groups, and constrained systems with multiplicative noise. Comparisons against classical Runge–Kutta–Milstein-type schemes demonstrate improved stability properties over long time integration without sacrificing convergence rates.

Our results reveal that intermittent heating driven by magneto-acoustic waves contributes significantly to temperature fluctuations on sub-arcsecond scales, while fine magnetic structures channel both upward plasma flows and localized cooling processes. Comparisons between simulated synthetic spectra and observed line profiles indicate that traditional semi-empirical models underestimate chromospheric inhomogeneities by up to an order of magnitude in density contrast.

Unlike conventional filtering or artificial viscosity techniques, the proposed framework balances stabilization and accuracy by enforcing an entropy-consistent relaxation mechanism that dynamically adjusts to local flow conditions. Analytical arguments demonstrate that this procedure maintains second-order accuracy in smooth regions and prevents unphysical overshoots associated with high-Mach-number simulations. Numerical experiments on canonical test problems—such as the one-dimensional shock tube and two-dimensional turbulent flows—confirm robustness across a wide range of Reynolds numbers and demonstrate a significant reduction in numerical artifacts without degrading kinetic fidelity.

In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component.

Analytical solutions are derived for slowly varying topography using multiple-scale techniques, allowing the evolution of wave amplitude, celerity, and phase to be predicted as functions of local depth variation. Numerical simulations complement the asymptotic analysis, confirming the validity of reduced equations under weakly dispersive conditions. The results reveal that bottom friction leads to noticeable attenuation accompanied by small distortions in wave shape, while topographic gradients primarily influence phase modulation and potential reflection effects. Comparison between solitary and periodic regimes demonstrates distinct decay laws: solitary waves exhibit amplitude-dependent damping whereas periodic trains evolve according to coupled envelope dynamics controlled by effective friction coefficients.

We introduce and investigate globally defined geometric structures that arise from classes of Finsler metrics distinguished by curvature, torsion, or holonomy properties, with an emphasis on those satisfying additional regularity or symmetry constraints. Our approach builds upon a modern tensorial formalism that allows for coordinate-free descriptions, making explicit the interplay between local differential properties and global topological invariants. We extend known characterizations of Berwald, Landsberg, and C-reducible manifolds to broader settings in which completeness and compactness assumptions are relaxed but certain curvature bounds hold. A particular focus is given to constructing invariant functionals whose critical points correspond to special Finsler structures, enabling variational methods in classification problems. Furthermore, we study morphisms between such manifolds preserving their distinguished tensors and explore conditions under which these preserve geodesic completeness or metric equivalence class. Several examples illustrate how these concepts unify disparate results in classical Finsler geometry while opening new avenues for applications such as geometric control theory on curved spaces. The paper concludes with remarks on potential extensions toward pseudo-Finsler frameworks relevant in mathematical relativity.\n\nWould you like me to also produce a short list of keywords appropriate for Arxiv indexing?"

Calculations show that potassium atoms preferentially occupy gallery sites between graphene layers, inducing charge transfer from K to C and leading to partial ionic character in the bonding. This electron donation significantly modifies the electronic density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in metallic conductivity and notable lattice expansion along the c-axis. The formation energy and diffusion barriers are evaluated for various K concentrations to understand staging phenomena commonly observed experimentally. Analysis of charge density differences reveals strong polarization effects within adjacent carbon planes, while projected density-of-states calculations highlight hybridization between potassium 4s orbitals and π* states of graphite. The computed binding energies demonstrate favorable thermodynamic stability for stages corresponding to KC\\(_8\\) stoichiometry but indicate reduced stability for higher loading ratios due to interlayer repulsion.

We revisit classical definitions via spherical Radon transforms on the unit sphere, extend them through generalized cosine transforms to broader function classes, and analyze stability properties under perturbations of the underlying star body. Furthermore, spectral techniques are employed to characterize when a given body is an intersection body in various dimensions, yielding refined criteria that bridge known results with new functional-analytic perspectives.

The resulting effective action reveals consistent propagation for all fluctuation modes with identical dispersion relations up to second order in curvature deviations. We further identify conserved currents dictated by residual null symmetries that stabilize this universality beyond semiclassical limits. Potential implications include simplifications in holographic dualities and constraints on renormalization flows under high-frequency perturbations. These results suggest a common mathematical texture underlying disparate covariant theories when probed through pp-wave expansions near null geodesic bundles."

Artificial opal structures composed of closely packed silica spheres were employed as a tunable three-dimensional photonic crystal environment. Under pulsed laser excitation, localized luminescent responses were observed that exhibited distinctive spectral narrowing and delayed emission phenomena compared to bulk silica reference samples. Time-resolved measurements indicate that energy transfer processes within the periodic lattice contribute significantly to lifetime elongation and emission intensity enhancement. The energetical analysis reveals threshold-like behavior consistent with nonlinear optical amplification within defect-mediated microcavities formed in the opal matrix. Comparative studies across varying sphere diameters demonstrate strong dependence on photonic band-gap alignment relative to excitation wavelength, confirming structural control over light localization mechanisms responsible for the flame-like emission dynamics. These results provide new insight into collective radiative effects arising from ordered dielectric networks and suggest potential applications in low-threshold photonic sources, nanoscale sensors, and energy concentration devices exploiting spatially confined electromagnetic modes in synthetic opaline media subjected to transient optical pumping conditions."

Our approach integrates Bayesian inference with machine-learning based pattern recognition to detail the early evolution of GRB light curves and spectra, thereby improving constraints on jet geometry, energetics, and environmental density profiles. Using an archival sample spanning over a decade of Swift operations, we demonstrate that rapid calibration updates reduce systematic uncertainties in flux measurements by approximately 15%, enabling more robust comparisons between short- and long-duration populations. Moreover, we discuss strategies for cross-matching contemporaneous data from ground-based optical telescopes to refine redshift estimates when spectroscopic follow-up is limited.

Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability densities are analyzed to establish a statistically consistent framework for uncovering deterministic or stochastic relationships between observables. The proposed approach employs nonparametric density estimation combined with uncertainty quantification to allow an unbiased inference of functional dependencies even in the presence of measurement noise or incomplete sampling. By interpreting the physical law as a conditional expectation value within the joint distribution, this method distinguishes intrinsic correlations from random fluctuations and systematically identifies the most probable analytical form of y₀(x). Furthermore, we discuss computational implementations using kernel methods and Bayesian regularization that ensure stability across varying data resolutions. Applications to representative datasets—from thermodynamic measurements to nonlinear optical responses—illustrate how the procedure captures hidden scaling behaviors and critical points without prior assumptions on functional shape. This unified statistical formulation thus provides a rigorous bridge between empirical observation and theoretical model construction, offering an efficient route for automating physical law discovery from high-dimensional experimental data streams."

Our approach employs precomputed grids of molecular excitation solutions linked to Bayesian inference tools, enabling rapid derivation of posterior distributions for multiple physical parameters simultaneously. We benchmark the methodology against both synthetic spectra generated from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and archival survey data from prominent facilities such as ALMA and SOFIA. The results demonstrate that our optimized pipeline reproduces key line intensity ratios within observational uncertainties while reducing computation times by over an order of magnitude compared to conventional iterative schemes. This capability supports more comprehensive exploration of parameter space, facilitates automated analysis across many sources, and enables deeper statistical population studies critical for understanding chemical evolution in diverse galactic environments."

This relationship provides a predictive measure for identifying when additional experiments yield diminishing returns in terms of novel information. We validate our approach using both simulated nonlinear dynamical systems and empirical datasets from physical chemistry and ecological modeling, demonstrating consistent agreement between theoretical expectations and observed improvements in understanding. The proposed method offers not only an operational definition of complexity but also practical guidance for experimental design under constraints of time or resources.

In the closed form, extended conjugation allows efficient coupling to Au electrodes, resulting in high current flow, whereas in the open form, disrupted conjugation leads to a substantial conductance drop. Projected density of states and transmission spectra indicate that frontier orbitals near the Fermi level dominate charge transport, and their energy alignment shifts significantly upon photoisomerization. Furthermore, bias‑dependent I–V characteristics demonstrate robust bistable behavior consistent with experimental observations of reversible optical switching. The calculated on/off ratio exceeds two orders of magnitude under typical operating conditions, highlighting excellent potential for molecular memory or logic applications.

Simulations were conducted over a range from 100 K to 1200 K under uniaxial tension and compression conditions. Results indicate that increasing temperature leads to gradual softening of interlayer van der Waals interactions, resulting in reduced Young’s modulus and tensile strength but enhanced flexibility prior to failure. Structural analyses reveal that radial expansion is anisotropic with respect to tube orientation, while high-temperature regimes induce local buckling and defect formation at junction regions.

Molecular dynamics trajectories suggest that transient threading events during folding can give rise to knot formation if stabilized by local interactions or cofactor binding.

Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has enabled a comprehensive characterization of the stellar population, circumstellar environments, and ongoing star formation processes within this nearby young cluster. Using imaging from IRAC and MIPS, we identify sources exhibiting infrared excesses indicative of disks and protostellar envelopes across a wide luminosity range. Combining these data with near‑infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy allows refined estimates of stellar masses, ages, accretion rates, and spectral energy distributions. We find that disk fractions vary strongly with spatial position inside the nebula core, tracing both local extinction gradients and evolutionary progression away from dense molecular filaments. The resulting catalog extends previous membership lists to substellar limits while providing improved constraints on pre‑main sequence lifetimes at solar metallicity. Comparison with similar Spitzer surveys of other Perseus subclusters reveals consistent environmental effects on disk dispersal timescales driven by local feedback rather than cluster mass or age alone. This integrated dataset establishes IC 348 as one of the most thoroughly sampled templates for studying early low‑mass stellar evolution in complex molecular cloud environments observable in the mid‑infrared regime."

We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest.

In central Au+Au events, the away-side peak—associated with back-to-back jets—is broadened or split compared to reference systems without a hot dense medium.

Furthermore, the recent data allow fora new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observationof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. Thisnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. Ifwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equalmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringentconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of thesubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with theuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of darkmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slightimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules outmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between thestandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.",
    "ai_generated_text": "(Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak-lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the mass distribution and dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters in the context of the ΛCDM cosmological model. Our analysis focuses on a sample of well-studied clusters exhibiting complex morphologies and evidence for ongoing mergers. X-ray surface brightness and temperature maps reveal significant departures from hydrostatic equilibrium, while strong lensing reconstructions highlight central mass concentrations beyond standard scaling relations. Weak-lensing measurements provide complementary constraints at larger radii, enabling a robust estimate of total cluster masses and substructure fractions. Optical spectroscopy indicates substantial velocity dispersion gradients consistent with anisotropic accretion along filaments. We compare these multiwavelength observational trends with high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that incorporate gas cooling, star formation, AGN feedback, and realistic merger histories. The simulated clusters reproduce many observed features but tend to underestimate the prevalence of massive subhaloes in dynamically unrelaxed systems. Discrepancies suggest refinements in modeling baryonic physics or more complete treatment of non-thermal pressure support in intracluster media. Our findings emphasize the importance of joint analyses combining diverse probes to understand both equilibrium states and transient phenomena shaping cluster assembly histories within ΛCDM.\n\nWould you like me to also generate a short list of keywords for this abstract?"

The wavelength intervalexplored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration timerender our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different statesof the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described inthe literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in theH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in theV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contraryto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights ofNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours.

By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS2, we investigate the temporal evolution of its multiwavelength continuum and polarization properties to assess the physical processes driving its non-thermal emission. Using a coordinated campaign combining optical, X-ray, and γ-ray monitoring over several months, we derive time-resolved spectra and cross-correlate flux variations among bands to identify characteristic timescales and spectral hysteresis patterns. Our analysis reveals that correlated flaring episodes are accompanied by clear spectral hardening during rising phases, consistent with rapid particle acceleration in compact jet regions followed by synchrotron cooling. Variations in polarization degree and angle further support a scenario involving evolving magnetic field orientations rather than purely geometric effects. We model these behaviors within both one-zone leptonic frameworks and hybrid scenarios incorporating weak hadronic contributions; comparisons indicate that synchrotron self-Compton models reproduce most observed trends but require modest departures from equipartition conditions. The results highlight the importance of simultaneous multi-band spectroscopy for disentangling jet energetics from radiative losses, providing refined constraints on particle distributions, magnetic field geometry, and Doppler factors governing BL Lac variability phenomenology."

Weak Brackett and He I emission lines are also evident, indicating persistent ionized gas within the accretion flow or disk atmosphere. By modeling the combined stellar and disk components, we estimate a flux ratio implying that the donor contributes roughly 60–70% of the total near-infrared light in quiescent conditions. Comparison with previous photometric measurements shows that A0620-00 exhibits mild variability at these wavelengths over timescales of months, consistent with low-level mass transfer fluctuations observed in other black hole binaries at similar states. Our spectral decomposition yields constraints on temperature gradients within the outer disk and suggests minimal contamination from synchrotron radiation at NIR frequencies.

This comprehensive data set provides an unprecedented view of its variability and emission mechanisms over a range of timescales. Significant correlated flux variations were detected between the optical and X-ray regimes, indicating a common origin of the synchrotron component likely associated with shocks propagating through the relativistic jet. Analysis of polarization measurements corroborates a scenario involving magnetic field ordering during flaring episodes. The SED modeling was performed within single-zone leptonic frameworks, yielding constraints on key physical parameters such as particle energy distributions, magnetic field strength, and Doppler boosting factor. A gradual shift in synchrotron peak frequency observed across epochs suggests changes in acceleration efficiency or cooling rates within the emitting region. No statistically significant detection at TeV energies was achieved during this campaign; however, upper limits contribute valuable constraints on potential inverse-Compton emission components.

Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates ina spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on theother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detectionadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, andreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populatedthan the jovian mass range.

Aims: This motivates planet searches around stars which span a broad range of masses and evolutionary states, enabling direct comparisons with theoretical predictions for disk evolution and core accretion efficiency. Methods: We present results from a high-precision radial velocity survey targeting intermediate-mass subgiant stars using long-term monitoring with stabilized spectrographs. The sample was selected to minimize intrinsic stellar variability while preserving sensitivity to Jovian-mass companions at orbital periods up to several years. Results: We report the detection of several new giant planets orbiting evolved hosts between 1.3 and 2.0 M⊙, extending the empirical correlation between planet occurrence and host mass beyond the solar neighborhood main sequence. Statistical modeling indicates that more massive stars tend to host planets with larger minimum masses but exhibit comparable orbital distributions to solar-type systems once observational bias is accounted for. Conclusions: These findings support models in which enhanced solid surface density in massive protoplanetary disks promotes efficient giant planet formation, while later disk dispersal regulates migration histories. Our work underscores the importance of systematic multi-mass surveys for refining universal scaling relations between stellar attributes and planetary architectures across Galactic environments."

However, attempts to reconstructthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven moreproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, eitherduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced thefirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, commonenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massivewhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presentsinterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelopeevolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usualformulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution.

During this phase, frictional drag and tidal dissipation convert orbital energy into thermal energy within the envelope, driving its possible ejection while shrinking the separation between the stellar cores. Understanding this process is central to predicting outcomes such as compact binaries, Type Ia supernova progenitors, or gravitational-wave sources formed from post-common-envelope systems. We present analytic estimates and hydrodynamic simulations that explore how angular momentum redistribution governs envelope expulsion efficiency across initial mass ratios and evolutionary stages. Our results demonstrate that envelope binding energy profiles critically determine whether full ejection occurs or if remnants remain bound for extended thermal readjustment. By coupling these findings with population synthesis frameworks, we obtain improved constraints on final separations consistent with observed double-degenerate systems and low-mass X-ray binaries. This work reinforces common-envelope evolution as a universal regulator of close binary formation and highlights key uncertainties—particularly in transition from dynamical to viscous timescales—that must be resolved for predictive modeling of stellar mergers across cosmic environments."

We find that the overall binary fraction of acluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at latetimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in thecentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a corebinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining).

Each simulation incorporates a realistic stellar mass spectrum, two-body relaxation, and external tidal fields corresponding to typical galactic environments. We find that dynamical processing leads to substantial depletion of soft binaries within a few initial half-mass relaxation times, while hard binaries are preferentially retained or formed through three-body interactions in dense cores. The resulting binary fraction exhibits strong radial gradients: it decreases toward the outskirts due to evaporation and increases toward the center as mass segregation enhances encounter rates. Clusters starting with high primordial binary content maintain elevated fractions for most of their lifetimes but experience accelerated core contraction triggered by energy generation from binary burning. In contrast, low-binary clusters evolve more gradually and may develop moderate secondary populations driven by dynamical captures.

The proposed algorithm ensures reproducibility across detector granularities and significantly reduces ambiguities in the merging/splitting procedures that arise in dense environments such as heavy ion or high-luminosity proton collisions. We demonstrate analytically that this method reproduces the next-to-leading order jet cross sections consistent with perturbative QCD expectations, and validate its performance using simulated data from standard benchmark processes.

This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretionof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of doubleCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate.

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 M⊙ and a 0.6 M⊙ binary system is followed using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with adaptive resolution to capture both large-scale mass transfer and small-scale thermonuclear heating. Initially, stable Roche lobe overflow drives angular momentum loss from the system, leading to rapid spiral-in and tidal disruption of the lower-mass component. We analyze how differential rotation, shear instabilities, and shock heating redistribute entropy within the remnant core and disk structures over several dynamical timescales. Resulting temperature peaks approach conditions favorable for carbon ignition near the interface region, potentially triggering off-center deflagrations rather than central detonations depending on viscosity prescriptions adopted in post-merger relaxation phases. Subsequent viscous spreading converts orbital energy into thermal support, forming a hot corona that may facilitate delayed detonation or collapse into an accretion-induced neutron star depending on total mass and cooling efficiency via neutrino emission. We further compare outcomes across different initial mass ratios to map boundaries between super-Chandrasekhar events and stable remnant formation, providing theoretical constraints for Type Ia supernova progenitor scenarios observed in double-degenerate systems discovered by time-domain surveys."

The expansion is carried out up to second post-Newtonian order under slow-motion and weak-field assumptions relevant for astrophysical systems. We obtain corrections to the metric potentials that depend explicitly on the gradient and time derivative of the Chern-Simons coupling field, providing refined estimates for frame-dragging effects and gravitomagnetic interactions in rotating matter distributions. Comparison with general relativity shows that standard Newtonian results are recovered at leading order, while higher-order terms introduce potentially observable deviations measurable through precision experiments such as gyroscope precession or binary pulsar timing. Our analysis also identifies parameter regimes where nonlinear coupling between fluid vorticity and scalar field dynamics becomes significant, possibly yielding distinctive signatures beyond current observational constraints.

We present high-resolution ALMA observations of a sample of eight close binaries (semi-major axes < 1 AU) exhibiting circumbinary disks with well-defined inner cavities. Continuum and CO line imaging resolve asymmetric structures and streamer-like features bridging the gap between disk and stellar components. Kinematic modeling indicates that these flows originate near the truncation radius and deliver material at rates comparable to single-star systems, despite theoretical expectations for suppression. The morphology of accretion streams is consistent with quasi-steady-state replenishment rather than episodic infall, suggesting efficient angular momentum exchange between disk gas and binary orbits. Our findings imply that gap-crossing accretion is an important mechanism for sustaining circumstellar material around both components during late stages of disk evolution, with potential consequences for planet formation in circumbinary environments.

Numerical simulations are presented for representative planetary and binary systems, showing that minor deviations predicted by the five-dimensional model remain consistent with current observational limits while suggesting measurable consequences at extreme mass or distance regimes. The extended formalism also provides new insights into secular precession rates and perihelion shifts without invoking additional dark matter terms. Conceptually, this approach offers an alternative route toward unifying relativistic mechanics with higher-dimensional cosmologies through phenomenologically testable predictions in orbital datasets. The results strengthen the plausibility of treating large-scale dimensional extensions as physically relevant rather than purely mathematical constructs and highlight promising directions for future experimental verification using high-precision astrometric measurements."

The LB approach, originally conceived as a mesoscopic alternative to traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) schemes, has evolved into a versatile framework applicable to incompressible flows, thermal transport, and complex multiphase systems. Despite this progress, questions persist regarding its derivation from kinetic theory, optimal collision models for minimizing numerical artifacts, and accurate recovery of macroscopic governing equations under various boundary conditions. In particular, challenges arise in handling high Reynolds number flows without spurious oscillations and in integrating thermodynamically consistent treatments for non-ideal fluids. This work presents a systematic analysis that bridges discrete velocity formulations with continuum hydrodynamics through multi-scale expansions, clarifies the role of relaxation parameters in controlling dissipation versus accuracy trade-offs, and discusses robust strategies for enforcing boundary constraints on irregular geometries. Numerical experiments validate theoretical insights across benchmark problems including shear-driven cavities and buoyancy-driven convection. The results aim to provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance toward more reliable LB simulations across scientific and engineering applications."

The governing magnetohydrodynamic equations for torsional modes are solved under realistic boundary conditions at the loop footpoints, allowing us to quantify deviations from the uniform-density case. We find that even modest density gradients induce measurable shifts in oscillation frequencies, generally lowering them relative to homogeneous reference models due to increased inertia in denser regions. Wave profiles exhibit significant asymmetry and amplitude modulation, with nodes displaced toward regions of lower density. The sensitivity scales approximately linearly with fractional density variation for small contrasts but becomes markedly nonlinear for steep gradients or localized high-density segments. These effects have important implications for coronal seismology: inversion schemes that neglect longitudinal structuring may misestimate magnetic field strengths by up to 20%.

We have tried to point out mostof the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,which has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentumexpectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation valuereally turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentumexpectation value is real.

We emphasize how coordinate-dependent measure factors influence the Hermiticity of operators under the appropriate inner product and examine subtle differences between canonical and physical momentum definitions. The treatment incorporates both standard position representation and considerations arising from differential geometry on curved coordinate manifolds. Explicit expressions for radial and angular momentum operators are obtained, highlighting their commutation relations with position variables and demonstrating consistency with known eigenfunctions for hydrogen-like systems. We further discuss implications for quantization in non-Cartesian systems and potential pitfalls when translating Cartesian-form expressions directly into spherical coordinates without adjusting for metric factors. Our analysis offers pedagogical clarity while remaining rigorous, making it suitable both as an instructional complement to traditional introductions to quantum mechanics and as a reference for researchers dealing with problems naturally framed in spherical symmetry."

Numerical simulations employing detailed chemical kinetics were conducted to reproduce experimental results and provide insight into reaction pathways leading to aromatic formation. Comparisons among the three flames demonstrate that both allene and propene doping significantly modify oxidation routes by enhancing propargyl radical production, thereby promoting benzene inception at lower equivalence ratios than in pure methane combustion. Temperature distributions remain similar across all cases; however, carbon growth reactions are notably accelerated when unsaturated additives are present.

Numerical results indicate that tip-tip orientations lead to stronger longitudinal compression and higher local baryon densities, while body-body collisions preferentially produce more transverse flow and broader rapidity distributions. Stopping power is quantified through the degree of nuclear overlap, evolution of momentum anisotropy, and net-proton rapidity spectra extracted from transported particle ensembles. Comparison with existing experimental data suggests that ART1.0 captures essential features of nuclear stopping behavior when relativistic mean-field potentials are incorporated dynamically into scattering processes.

The high-resolution spectra cover the energy range from 0.5 to 10 keV and reveal a complex mixture of emission and absorption features associated with highly ionized species in the stellar wind of the donor star. Detailed modeling indicates multiple absorption zones spanning ionization parameters log ξ ≈ 1–3, consistent with an inhomogeneous, focused wind interacting with the black hole’s accretion flow. Narrow Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines trace material moving at velocities up to several hundred km s⁻¹, while weak emission components suggest partial reprocessing in extended regions near the disk–wind interface. Variability analysis over orbital phase shows modest changes in line depth, indicative of geometric effects linked to viewing angle through structured wind clumps. The continuum is well described by a composite model including a thermal disk component plus Comptonized hard emission, characteristic of the hard state observed contemporaneously by other missions. These findings provide improved constraints on mass-loss rates, ionization structure, and accretion geometry in one of the most studied high-mass X‑ray binaries."

One of the central questions in quantum information theory is how local operations, typically assumed only to preserve or diminish entanglement, can nevertheless lead to its enhancement under certain conditions involving nonunitary or environment-mediated dynamics. In this work we present explicit constructions where local channels—including amplitude damping and phase rotation—acting on a single qubit induce nontrivial changes in the joint state’s concurrence and von Neumann entropy. The analysis demonstrates how such transformations arise from effective redistribution of correlations between system and environment rather than direct unitary coupling between qubits. We further identify parameter regimes where the same interaction yields opposite effects depending on initial coherence phases, highlighting subtle dependencies not captured by simple monotonicity assumptions. These results refine our understanding of local control over bipartite quantum resources and have implications for entanglement management in open-system dynamics, noise-assisted state preparation, and symmetry-based error correction protocols.

A key issue examined is thedetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is oftenempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrumfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot bepre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretionrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earliersuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling thedisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra canbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the colorcorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectrawith other models.

We further assess how correlated parameters within Bayesian fitting frameworks impact confidence intervals for key quantities like black hole mass and emissivity index. By incorporating physically motivated priors derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate improved consistency across independent spectral epochs while underlining residual limitations caused by unmodeled time variability.

The transition occurs abruptly within one local free-fall time once the average Jeans mass drops below the critical value imposed by feedback heating. We quantify its dependence on metallicity and initial turbulence spectrum, finding that higher metallicities accelerate fragmentation while enhanced turbulent support delays it. This bimodal behavior offers an explanation for observed variations in stellar initial mass functions across galactic environments—from top-heavy distributions near starburst nuclei to bottom-heavy forms in quiescent molecular clouds.

Our sample includes clusters spanning a wide range of metallicity, total mass, and Galactic environment. Statistical correlations reveal that HB morphology strongly depends on internal helium variation rather than age or metallicity alone, indicating multiple stellar generations within these systems. Dynamical simulations further suggest that enhanced mass loss on the red-giant branch—possibly driven by rotation or binary interactions—amplifies helium-sensitive temperature spreads along the HB. Comparing observational data with synthetic population models constrains typical helium abundance variations to ΔY ≈ 0.05–0.10 across extended-HB clusters.

Analytical expressions are derived for voltage–current characteristics incorporating geometric correlations between superconducting channels, revealing anomalous power-law dependencies consistent with experimental trends in highly disordered thin films. The study demonstrates how geometric complexity controls vortex mobility at multiple length scales and provides insight into optimizing critical parameters through engineered disorder. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of magneto-transport phenomena in composite superconductors approaching the percolation threshold and offer guidelines for designing materials with tailored flux-pinning landscapes based on fractal microstructure control."

Using a fully microscopic framework, we analyze how collective variables evolve as two heavy ions approach contact and merge to form a compound system. Particular attention is paid to the competition between one-body dissipation mechanisms arising from nucleon exchange across a transient neck region and two-body collisional effects associated with fluctuations in density distributions. We employ stochastic extensions of time-dependent Hartree–Fock calculations to quantify relaxation times for mass asymmetry and quadrupole deformation, allowing direct comparison with experimental observables such as pre-equilibrium neutron emission and fusion hindrance phenomena. The results indicate that shape equilibration proceeds more rapidly than charge equilibration for asymmetric entrance channels at near-barrier energies, suggesting distinct microscopic origins for these processes. Furthermore, correlations introduced by shell structure modulate the effective friction coefficients governing relaxation dynamics. These findings contribute to developing predictive models for compound nucleus formation probabilities relevant to superheavy element synthesis and deep-inelastic collisions at low excitation energies."

A key result is the identification of topologically protected degeneracies in the ground-state manifold, which persist over a broad range of interaction strengths. The fractionalization mechanism is traced to interference effects arising from frustration-induced flat bands that localize charge while preserving long-range quantum coherence. By evaluating correlation functions and Chern numbers, we demonstrate adiabatic continuity between Mott insulating and fractional Chern insulating phases as kinetic constraints are tuned. Experimental implications for engineered optical lattices and moiré heterostructures are discussed, highlighting observable signatures such as quantized charge pumping and characteristic patterns in spectral responses measurable by tunneling probes.

This paper introduces the notion of \"canonicalnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacitiescan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that thethroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upperbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are manyhops away.

Our study reveals the critical role of bottleneck links near the sink node, which experience disproportionate traffic load due to converging flows; this leads to non-trivial degradation compared to end-to-end unicast throughput benchmarks. We further quantify the impact of hidden terminals and spatial reuse under varying carrier-sense thresholds, demonstrating that simple 802.11 mechanisms do not efficiently handle severe asymmetry in traffic patterns without careful parameter tuning or architectural interventions.
