Unlike the Schrödinger representation, the polymer framework is built on a non-separable Hilbert space where momentum operators are not densely defined, leading to modified notions of continuity and spectral properties. This approach enables the exploration of quantum systems with an intrinsic discreteness scale, often introduced via a fundamental length parameter. We investigate the consequences of adopting such a representation in simple mechanical models, focusing on how dynamical evolution, energy spectra, and semiclassical limits are altered. Particular emphasis is placed on effective descriptions that emerge from polymer quantization and their comparison with standard results in quantum mechanics. We also discuss potential phenomenological implications, including modifications to harmonic oscillator dynamics and changes in uncertainty relations. Our analysis highlights both mathematical subtleties and physical insights offered by this alternative quantization scheme, suggesting avenues for further research into its role as either an approximation tool or a fundamental description within quantum gravity-inspired frameworks."

Spin-modulated radialvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the firsttime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed thetheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) andNorton et al.

Spin-modulated variations in the emission-line profiles reveal changes in the accretion geometry between epochs, with notable differences in both the velocity-resolved line flux and phase-dependent continuum levels. Time-resolved spectroscopy indicates that the Balmer and He II lines exhibit periodic modulation consistent with accretion onto a magnetically truncated disk, while Doppler tomography maps show evolving structures in the ballistic stream and magnetically channeled flow. The 1991 data suggest a more symmetric emission distribution, whereas the 2001 observations display enhanced asymmetry, possibly linked to variations in mass transfer rate or magnetic field configuration. Measured radial velocity amplitudes support a white dwarf spin period consistent with prior photometric studies, and phase-resolved equivalent width changes imply variable optical depth effects within the accretion curtains. These results highlight long-term variability in EX Hya’s accretion morphology even during nominal quiescence, underscoring the importance of multi-epoch spectroscopy for constraining models of magnetically controlled accretion flows in IPs.

The proposed schemes are designed to preserve invariants, symmetries, and constraints inherent to the manifold, while accurately capturing stochastic effects arising from multiplicative noise. We formulate strong and weak order integrators that generalize classical stochastic Runge–Kutta methods, ensuring that each numerical update remains on the manifold without requiring ad‑hoc projection steps. Convergence properties are analyzed in both mean‑square and distributional senses, with particular attention to the interplay between non‑commutativity of driving vector fields and curvature of the state space. Numerical experiments illustrate performance on benchmark problems including rigid body motion with random torques, stochastic flows on matrix groups, and diffusion processes on spheres.

In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component.

Analytical asymptotic techniques are employed to derive evolution equations for key wave parameters, including amplitude, width, and velocity, under slow variation of topography and frictional effects. For solitary waves, perturbation analysis reveals how shoaling due to decreasing depth competes with amplitude decay induced by friction, leading to modified scaling laws compared with the frictionless case. For nonlinear periodic waves, modulations are studied using a multiple-scale approach, allowing explicit characterization of wavelength changes and attenuation rates. Numerical simulations complement the analytical results, confirming their validity across a range of slope gradients and friction coefficients. The interplay between dispersion, nonlinearity, gradual depth variation, and dissipation is shown to produce complex but predictable transformations of wave profiles.

We introduce and investigate globally defined geometric structures that arise from imposing specific curvature or torsion conditions on Finsler spaces, with particular emphasis on their intrinsic and extrinsic properties. The study begins with a review of the fundamental tensorial framework, including the Cartan connection and associated curvature decompositions, reformulated in a coordinate-free manner to facilitate global analysis. We then focus on subclasses such as Berwald, Landsberg, and Douglas manifolds, characterizing them through invariant conditions that remain valid across the entire manifold rather than within local charts. The interplay between these special structures and topological constraints is examined, leading to classification results under certain homogeneity or compactness assumptions. Several examples are constructed to illustrate how global geometric invariants—such as holonomy groups or characteristic classes—distinguish non-isometric manifolds within the same local type. Finally, we discuss applications to variational problems on Finsler manifolds and possible extensions to pseudo-Finsler geometry. The results contribute to unifying local differential-geometric techniques with global topological methods in the study of special Finsler spaces, providing a foundation for further developments in both pure geometry and mathematical physics contexts."

The bonding in the potassium–graphite compound is characterized by a predominantly ionic interaction between the potassium atoms and the graphene layers, accompanied by charge transfer from potassium to the carbon network. Density functional theory calculations are employed to determine the equilibrium geometries, electronic band structures, and formation energies of various staged intercalation configurations. The results reveal that potassium resides preferentially in gallery sites between graphene sheets, inducing an expansion of the interlayer spacing consistent with experimental observations. Analysis of charge density differences and Bader charges confirms significant electron donation from potassium to the π-system of graphite, leading to pronounced changes in electronic dispersion near the Fermi level. The computed formation energies indicate that stage-I and stage-II compounds are thermodynamically favored under typical synthesis conditions. Furthermore, phonon calculations suggest that intercalation produces modest lattice softening along c-axis modes while preserving in-plane stiffness. These findings provide quantitative insight into how alkali-metal intercalation modifies both structural and electronic properties of layered carbons, shedding light on mechanisms relevant for energy storage applications such as battery anodes and for tuning transport behavior in low-dimensional carbon systems."

The system’s short orbital period and deep primary eclipse enable robust modeling despite its single-lined nature. Radial velocity measurements yield the mass function, while eclipse geometry constrains the inclination, allowing us to break degeneracies inherent to spectroscopic binaries. We find that the M dwarf has a radius significantly larger than predicted by standard stellar models at its measured mass, consistent with trends seen in other low-mass stars where magnetic activity or metallicity effects may inflate radii. The primary’s parameters place it near the end of its main-sequence lifetime, offering an opportunity to test stellar evolution models across disparate mass regimes within a single system.

They are defined so that the radial function of one body coincides with the volumes of central hyperplane sections of another, enabling deep interplay between section functions and transform theory. This concept extends naturally to \\(L_p\\)-intersection bodies and their generalizations, allowing for refined characterizations via spherical harmonics and distributional formulations. The analytic approach leverages properties of the spherical Radon transform to explore injectivity, stability, and reconstruction phenomena. Moreover, generalized cosine transforms yield alternative inversion formulas and broaden applicability to anisotropic settings. Recent work has illuminated how intersection bodies fit into broader duality principles in Banach spaces and contribute to inequalities relating volume, surface area, and projection measures.

The analysis explores both commutators and anticommutators, distinguishing bosonic scalar/vector fields from fermionic spinor fields, and identifies constraints arising from Lorentz covariance, causality, and positivity of energy. Special attention is given to the role of equal-time relations in ensuring correct propagator structure and particle interpretation.

We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc.

We find that clusters with higher ρₕ exhibit a turnover at larger masses and display a narrower width in log mass compared to low-density clusters. This trend is consistent with dynamical mass loss dominated by two-body relaxation, which proceeds more rapidly in dense systems, preferentially depleting low-mass members over a Hubble time. Conversely, low-density clusters retain proportionally more low-mass objects but are more susceptible to tidal shocks and external disruption, leading to an overall flattening of their GCMF at the low-mass end. By comparing our observational results to direct N-body models incorporating stellar evolution and Galactic tidal fields, we show that the observed ρₕ dependence can be reproduced if initial cluster mass functions were approximately universal but evolved differentially according to internal densities.

As a consequence, both gauge and matter fields exhibit simplified propagators and mode expansions, with their equations of motion reducing to universal forms across diverse theories ranging from Yang–Mills to higher-spin systems and string sigma models. We illustrate how this phenomenon arises from the covariant expansion of the action, highlighting cancellations in curvature couplings and identifying common effective operators governing fluctuations. The result has implications for high-energy scattering in curved space-times, holographic dualities involving pp-wave limits, and the classification of universal infrared behaviors. Our analysis suggests that pp-wave backgrounds serve as a unifying framework for probing field-theoretic structures beyond flat space while retaining analytic control over dynamical modes."

Artificial optical structures supporting localized photonic modes were fabricated to investigate the interplay between high-intensity excitation and transient light emission phenomena. The experiments employed nanostructured dielectric arrays designed to enhance local field confinement, enabling precise measurement of emission spectra over a broad wavelength range. Spectral analysis revealed distinct narrowband peaks superimposed on a broadband background, indicating simultaneous coherent and incoherent contributions to the observed radiation. Energetic measurements demonstrated nonlinear growth in emission intensity with increasing pump power, consistent with threshold-like behavior characteristic of photonic flame onset. Temporal dynamics were resolved using fast photodetectors and time-correlated single-photon counting, showing sub-nanosecond rise times followed by multi-exponential decay components linked to different relaxation pathways within the structure. The combined spectral–temporal data suggest that strong coupling between localized modes and induced carriers plays a central role in sustaining the flame-like emission state. These findings deepen the understanding of transient photonic phenomena in structured media and may inform future designs for ultrafast light sources, optical sensors, and energy-efficient photonic devices operating under extreme excitation conditions."

By adapting the timing argument—originally developed to estimate the mass of the Local Group from its current separation and approach velocity—we derive an analytic scaling relation between total system mass, collision kinematics, and cosmic age.

Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability density functions are employed to characterize both the underlying relationship between the variables and the uncertainty arising from measurement noise and finite sampling. A nonparametric statistical framework is proposed, wherein kernel-based estimators are used to approximate the probability densities directly from discrete observations without imposing a predetermined functional form. The most probable functional dependence is then identified by maximizing the conditional probability density of y given x, yielding an empirical law that can adapt to nonlinear or multivalued behaviors. The method inherently accounts for heteroscedasticity through local variance estimation and quantifies predictive uncertainty via confidence intervals derived from the conditional distribution. Its performance is demonstrated on synthetic datasets with known analytical laws as well as on real experimental measurements subject to significant noise. Comparisons with conventional regression approaches highlight improved robustness against outliers and model misspecification. This probabilistic formulation provides a generalizable tool for inferring physical laws from empirical data, particularly in contexts where theoretical models are incomplete or unavailable, enabling more reliable predictions and deeper insight into complex systems."

By integrating machine learning emulators trained on full radiative transfer solutions, the method accelerates likelihood evaluations by orders of magnitude without sacrificing fidelity. We demonstrate the technique on synthetic datasets mimicking ALMA and JWST observations of star-forming regions and circumstellar disks, recovering input parameters within statistical uncertainties even for noisy or incomplete spectra. This strategy is readily adaptable to large surveys and heterogeneous data sources, offering a scalable solution for the interpretation of molecular line emission in the era of big-data astronomy.

Conversely, the open form disrupts conjugation, leading to localized states and a significant reduction in transmission near the Fermi level. The calculated current–voltage characteristics reveal an ON/OFF conductance ratio exceeding two orders of magnitude, demonstrating robust photo-controlled switching behavior. Transmission spectra analysis indicates that transport is dominated by resonant tunneling through molecular orbitals whose energies shift upon structural isomerization.

Structural parameters such as interlayer spacing, bond length variations, and radial deformation are quantified under equilibrium and stress-loaded conditions. Mechanical responses—including Young’s modulus, tensile strength, and critical buckling load—are derived from simulated stress–strain curves at each temperature point. Results indicate that while SWCNTs maintain high stiffness up to approximately 800 K, significant reductions in modulus and strength occur beyond this threshold due to increased anharmonic lattice vibrations and bond weakening. Thermal expansion effects lead to measurable changes in radial geometry, influencing load transfer between layers. The findings reveal a nonlinear correlation between temperature rise and mechanical property degradation, with implications for designing nanotube-based composites for high-temperature environments.

Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground-based spectra has enabled a comprehensive characterization of the young stellar population, protostellar candidates, and circumstellar disk properties within this nearby star-forming region. Using imaging from IRAC and MIPS, we identify sources exhibiting infrared excess indicative of disks and envelopes across the Class 0–III evolutionary sequence. Spectroscopic follow-up in the optical and near-infrared refines stellar classifications, confirms youth indicators such as Hα emission and lithium absorption, and constrains spectral energy distributions. We map the spatial distribution of young stellar objects relative to the dense gas structures revealed by complementary CO measurements, uncovering evidence for sub-clustering and ongoing star formation along filamentary cores. The combined dataset enables an assessment of disk fractions as a function of age and position within IC 348, revealing a gradient consistent with sequential star formation triggered by local feedback processes. Our results provide an updated inventory of members down to substellar masses, improving estimates of the initial mass function in this region. This work demonstrates how mid-infrared surveys coupled with ground-based spectroscopy yield a holistic view of clustered star formation environments."

Here we analyze the performance ofRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selectedfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributedentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest.

We model the MIMO link using both deterministic and stochastic channel representations, and examine how different feedback protocols—ranging from instantaneous full channel state information (CSI) to low-rate quantized CSI—impact achievable capacity and bit error rate. A key contribution is the formulation of an optimization framework that jointly considers feedback compression, precoder selection, and robustness against outdated or noisy CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that carefully designed finite-rate feedback schemes can approach the performance of ideal full-CSI systems while significantly reducing overhead. Furthermore, we analyze trade-offs between spatial multiplexing gain and diversity gain in relation to feedback quality, providing guidelines for system designers targeting next-generation wireless standards.

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subclusterwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions ofthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionlessgalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on theself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, usingsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, andcomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow fora new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observationof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. Thisnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. Ifwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equalmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringentconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of thesubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with theuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of darkmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slightimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules outmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between thestandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.",
    "ai_generated_text": "(Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak‑lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of massive galaxy clusters in a ΛCDM cosmology. Our analysis focuses on the interplay between baryonic physics and dark matter in shaping the observed mass distribution, thermodynamic profiles, and substructure content. We compile multi‑wavelength measurements for a representative sample of dynamically relaxed and disturbed systems, deriving mass profiles from both lensing reconstructions and hydrostatic equilibrium methods. These are contrasted with high‑resolution hydrodynamical simulations incorporating radiative cooling, star formation, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. We find that the combination of lensing and X‑ray data provides stringent constraints on cluster concentration parameters, while weak‑lensing shear maps help resolve large‑scale asymmetries linked to recent merger activity. Simulations reproduce the general trends in mass–concentration relations but tend to underpredict central baryon fractions unless strong feedback is included. Discrepancies between hydrostatic and lensing masses persist at the 10–20% level, particularly for unrelaxed clusters. Our results highlight the need for improved modelling of non‑thermal pressure support and more precise calibration of mass proxies to fully exploit upcoming wide‑field surveys for precision cosmology using galaxy clusters."

The data reveal significant changes in both synchrotron and inverse Compton components on timescales of days to weeks, with correlated shifts in peak frequency and amplitude. Through spectral fitting with homogeneous one-zone leptonic models, we assess the role of particle acceleration efficiency, magnetic field strength variations, and Doppler factor changes in driving the observed variability patterns. We find that episodes of enhanced high-energy emission are accompanied by hardening of the synchrotron spectrum, consistent with rapid injection of relativistic electrons. Cross-correlation analysis between bands supports a scenario in which optical–X-ray flares originate from compact regions within the jet, while radio flux responds more slowly due to opacity effects. These results provide stringent constraints on jet dynamics and radiative processes in BL Lac objects, highlighting PKS2 as a benchmark source for testing time-dependent blazar emission models."

Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates ina spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on theother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b.

Methods: We report results from a targeted radial velocity survey of 120 nearby stars, combining high-precision spectroscopic measurements with stellar characterization from Gaia parallaxes and photometry. We perform Keplerian fits to detect planetary signals and apply injection–recovery simulations to quantify detection sensitivity as a function of stellar mass. Results: We identify eight new sub-Jovian planets orbiting stars between 0.3 and 2.5 M⊙, with minimum masses ranging from 10 M⊕ to 0.8 MJup and orbital periods between 15 and 400 days. Statistical analysis reveals a tentative increase in giant planet occurrence for stars above ~1.5 M⊙, alongside enhanced multiplicity among low-mass hosts for small planets (<20 M⊕). Conclusions: Our findings support the core accretion paradigm while suggesting that disk mass scaling with stellar mass plays a crucial role in shaping planetary system architectures.

    "ai_generated_text": "Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the resulting drag forces lead to rapid orbital decay. This phase is critical in the evolution of close binary systems, often determining whether the system will survive as a compact binary or merge entirely. The inspiral within the shared envelope releases orbital energy and angular momentum into the surrounding material, potentially ejecting it into space. Understanding common envelope evolution is essential for predicting populations of X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, and progenitors of gravitational wave sources such as double neutron stars or black hole binaries. However, modeling this process remains challenging due to its inherently three-dimensional hydrodynamics, complex thermodynamics, and uncertain efficiency of envelope ejection. In this work, we present high-resolution numerical simulations that track both orbital evolution and gas dynamics during the common envelope phase for a range of stellar masses and initial separations. We quantify energy transfer mechanisms and assess conditions under which complete envelope removal occurs. Our results demonstrate how variations in companion mass and initial orbital parameters shape post-common-envelope separations, providing constraints for binary population synthesis models and informing observational strategies for identifying remnants of this short-lived but transformative evolutionary stage."

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO whitedwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use anelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles thanearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the centralregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of aslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by acentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant thatmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamicstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellarevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled byneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, andthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effectiveaccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretionof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of doubleCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply thatat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered goodcandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, thecharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventualexplosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).",

We follow the system from the onset of unstable mass transfer through the violent coalescence phase to the formation of a remnant supported by differential rotation. The initial disruption of the secondary leads to rapid accretion streams impacting the primary, generating strong shocks, localized heating, and transient nuclear burning in regions exceeding 10⁸ K. We quantify angular momentum redistribution via gravitational torques and viscous processes, showing how disk–remnant coupling drives secular evolution on timescales up to 10⁴ s after merger. The remnant structure consists of a cold degenerate core surrounded by a hot envelope and an extended Keplerian disk, whose thermal and dynamical properties determine potential observational signatures such as optical transients or delayed detonations. Our results constrain conditions under which such mergers may lead to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae versus stable massive white dwarfs, providing insights into progenitor demographics in binary stellar populations and contributing to models connecting compact object mergers with thermonuclear explosions."

We present multi-wavelength observations and hydrodynamic modeling of a sample of spectroscopic binaries with orbital separations less than 1 AU, aimed at constraining the structure and dynamics of their circumbinary environments. High-resolution ALMA continuum imaging reveals ring-like morphologies with depleted dust emission interior to radii consistent with predicted truncation boundaries. Simultaneously, near-infrared spectroscopy detects accretion signatures indicative of ongoing mass transfer across the gap. Our numerical models reproduce both the observed cavity sizes and the presence of transient accretion streams, showing that disk viscosity and binary eccentricity strongly regulate mass flow rates.

In this companion paper, the principle ofconservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value ofar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely onkey cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitationalconstant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law ofgravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary betweena four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking thespeed of light to the mass of the Universe.",
    "ai_generated_text": "The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors. In that work, the additional dimensional framework was shown to yield novel corrections to classical and relativistic predictions for closed orbital systems. Here, we extend the analysis to a broader class of gravitational configurations, including highly eccentric trajectories and multi-body interactions, with particular emphasis on stability criteria and resonant behaviours. The fifth dimension is modelled as a large-scale curvature parameter influencing geodesic motion via modified metric coefficients, leading to small but measurable deviations from Newtonian and general relativistic orbits. Analytical solutions are derived for simplified cases, while numerical integration is employed for complex systems. Results indicate potential signatures in long-term orbital precession rates and energy exchange patterns between interacting bodies. These deviations could be detectable in high-precision astrometric datasets from planetary systems or binary stars, offering a possible empirical route to testing higher-dimensional extensions of space-time. The findings suggest that incorporating such a dimension within gravitational theory may provide deeper insight into unexplained anomalies in celestial mechanics without contradicting established observational constraints. Future work will focus on refining parameter bounds and exploring cosmological implications."

By mapping local philicity values onto molecular surfaces via computational visualization tools, we identify reactive hotspots that correlate strongly with experimentally observed regioselectivity in electrophilic substitution reactions. Our results demonstrate that local philicity serves as a robust predictor of preferred reaction sites, outperforming traditional charge-based or frontier orbital analyses in systems where electronic delocalization is significant. Furthermore, we explore the influence of substituent effects and solvent polarity on the distribution of local philicity across molecular scaffolds. This approach not only deepens mechanistic understanding but also provides a practical framework for rational design in synthetic chemistry.

Nanoindentation and shear testing reveal that these layers exhibit gradient-dependent viscoelastic-plastic behavior, with stiffness increasing towards the substrate interface. In situ tribometry under controlled temperature and load conditions demonstrates that the rheological response is influenced by both the applied shear rate and thermal activation processes, leading to time-dependent deformation and recovery. The interplay between structural layering and mechanical compliance is linked to enhanced wear protection through energy dissipation and crack-arrest mechanisms. A mechanistic model is proposed that couples film microstructure evolution with its viscoelastic-plastic rheology, providing predictive capability for performance under mixed rolling/sliding conditions.

We have tried to point out mostof the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,which has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentumexpectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation valuereally turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentumexpectation value is real.

This omission can lead to confusion when addressing problems exhibiting spherical symmetry, such as central potential systems or angular momentum coupling. In spherical coordinates, the canonical momentum components are not simply obtained by replacing derivatives with respect to Cartesian variables; rather, they must be derived carefully from the underlying metric structure of the coordinate system and the requirements of Hermiticity with respect to the appropriate volume element. Here we present a systematic derivation of the radial and angular components of the momentum operator starting from the general expression for operators in curvilinear coordinates. We emphasize how these components differ from their classical counterparts due to additional terms arising from coordinate-dependent measures in quantum mechanics. The radial momentum operator, in particular, acquires a term proportional to \\(1/r\\) ensuring self-adjointness under integration over three-dimensional space. We also discuss implications for commutation relations, eigenvalue problems, and their role in solving Schrödinger’s equation for spherically symmetric potentials.

We develop a probabilistic framework that extends classical martingale methods to accommodate temperature-dependent drift terms, enabling precise characterization of the long-time behavior of the system. Our analysis reveals that the high temperature phase induces a qualitative change in population spread: whereas low temperature configurations are dominated by localized clusters, elevated temperatures lead to delocalization and exponential growth across types. We identify critical thresholds for parameter combinations separating extinction from explosive growth, and derive asymptotic profiles for the spatial distribution and type composition of surviving populations. These results extend earlier work by incorporating thermal scaling limits and demonstrating universality across broad classes of branching kernels. Potential applications include modeling of reaction–diffusion systems in fluctuating environments, ecological dispersal under climate change scenarios, and stochastic gene propagation in heterogeneous media.

The analysis covers bound, unbound, and precessing trajectories, allowing for arbitrary eccentricity and inclination relative to the symmetry axis of the source. We find that the quadrupole moment produces additional coupling between orbital angular momentum and radiation-reaction forces, modifying both the inspiral rate and precession dynamics compared to a purely spherical source. In particular, axial asymmetry leads to characteristic modulations in the energy and angular momentum fluxes carried by gravitational waves, which can accumulate over many orbital cycles to produce measurable deviations from standard point-mass inspiral templates. These results are relevant for modeling extreme mass-ratio inspirals around deformed compact objects such as rotating neutron stars or black holes with environmental-induced multipole moments.

Here, we develop a more general framework for systematically introducing controlled deformations into singular Calabi–Yau manifolds that correspond to specific gauge symmetry breaking patterns. Our approach incorporates both local and global aspects of the geometry, enabling a consistent treatment of moduli spaces and coupling constants derived from the compactification. We provide explicit constructions using toric methods and analyze the resulting physical spectra via correspondence with quiver gauge theories. Furthermore, we extend the deformation procedure to include flux backgrounds, thereby capturing a wider class of phenomenologically relevant models. The mathematical formalism is complemented by examples illustrating transitions between distinct phases of moduli space and identifying conditions under which supersymmetry is preserved or broken. These results not only generalize prior work but also open new avenues for connecting geometrical engineering techniques with modern developments in holography, dualities, and topological string theory. Potential applications include refined model building in particle physics and deeper insights into non-perturbative dynamics of gauge theories.\n\nWould you like me to also create a short set of keywords for your arXiv submission?"

The dispersed spectra reveal a complex continuum well described by a power-law with photon index Γ ≈ 1.7, modified by both neutral and ionized absorption components. Numerous narrow absorption and emission features are detected, predominantly from H-like and He-like ions of Fe, Si, S, Mg, and Ne, indicating the presence of a structured stellar wind from the O-type companion.

The Fe K region shows both narrow absorption components and a broadened emission feature suggestive of reprocessing in the inner accretion environment. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals modest variability in line strengths correlated with changes in continuum flux, implying dynamical interactions between the compact object’s X-ray emission and the focused stellar wind.

One of the key motivations is to clarify how local operations, when combined with specific environmental couplings, can lead to non-intuitive changes in bipartite entanglement measures. We consider a minimal model in which one qubit undergoes a controlled unitary rotation or dissipative evolution while the other remains isolated. By explicitly tracking the concurrence and von Neumann entropy of the reduced states, we demonstrate regimes where local dynamics enhance correlations between the two qubits, as well as regimes where they diminish them. These behaviors arise from the interplay between phase coherence and amplitude redistribution in the composite state space. The examples provide analytic expressions for time-dependent entanglement under these conditions, illustrating that local interactions cannot be trivially classified as either purely destructive or constructive to quantum correlations. Our construction emphasizes that even single-qubit manipulations must be evaluated within a global framework to predict entanglement evolution accurately. The results have implications for quantum control protocols, error correction strategies, and understanding non-Markovian effects in open quantum systems, highlighting subtle aspects of locality in quantum mechanics."

A model in which thedust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperaturesaccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as amodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperaturesaccording to distance.

The inferred disk mass is a few lunar masses, comparable to other debris disks around similar-aged stars. These results support scenarios in which planetesimal formation proceeds efficiently in disks around late-type stars and persists into ages where gas has largely dissipated.

A key issue examined is thedetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is oftenempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrumfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot bepre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretionrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earliersuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling thedisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra canbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the colorcorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectrawith other models.

We assess the impact of assumptions about disk geometry, coronal heating mechanisms, and relativistic effects on parameter estimation. Particular attention is given to the interplay between thermal disk emission and non-thermal Comptonized components, as well as the role of reflection features distorted by strong gravity. We highlight challenges in disentangling intrinsic source variability from observational noise and instrumental systematics. Using simulated datasets informed by current missions, we quantify biases introduced by incomplete modeling or neglect of physical processes such as disk winds or jet contributions.

Above the threshold—characterized by dense, gravitationally bound filaments—the collapse proceeds rapidly into a small number of massive protostellar cores, yielding an initial mass function (IMF) skewed toward high stellar masses. Below this threshold, fragmentation is enhanced by turbulent compression and magnetic tension, producing numerous low-mass cores with a steep IMF slope. The transition appears abrupt in parameter space and is reproducible across different turbulence driving schemes (solenoidal vs. compressive). Analysis of accretion histories reveals that feedback from massive stars quenches further fragmentation above the threshold, while in the low-density regime feedback remains negligible.

By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations across a range of bending rigidities and surface tension parameters, we identify clear structural transitions between phases characterized by their global geometry and local order. In the tubular phase, the surface elongates into quasi-one-dimensional cylindrical shapes driven by anisotropic fluctuations. The planar phase emerges when tension suppresses curvature, yielding extended sheet-like configurations with minimal Gaussian curvature. The spherical phase corresponds to compact, isotropic configurations stabilized by high bending rigidity. Phase boundaries are determined from analysis of shape descriptors such as radius of gyration tensor eigenvalues and orientational correlation functions. Our results reveal that topology remains fixed but morphology changes sharply at transition points, suggesting underlying first-order or continuous nature depending on parameter paths. This study provides insight into the interplay between thermal fluctuations and elastic energy in soft matter systems, with potential relevance for biological membranes and synthetic vesicles under varying constraints."

In this framework, the fractal dimensionality of cluster boundaries governs the scaling behavior of vortex trapping efficiency, as well as the statistical distribution of pinning energies. Analytical modeling based on percolation theory and scaling relations is complemented by numerical simulations that account for realistic cluster morphologies.

Implications for tailored pinning in high-temperature superconductors are discussed, emphasizing how controlled introduction of fractal normal-phase inclusions could optimize performance under mixed-state operating conditions.

After outlining the standard axioms for Boolean algebras—covering associativity, commutativity, distributivity, identity elements, complements—we explore their model-theoretic properties. Using standard interpretations over two-element structures and general set-based models, we argue that Boolean Algebra, when treated purely as an equational theory in first-order logic with equality, achieves completeness in the sense that all semantically valid equations are derivable from the axioms. The discussion connects this result to Gödel’s Completeness Theorem and highlights how compactness plays a role in showing that no “missing” truths exist outside the deductive system.

Wealso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extendedand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission fromlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios fromsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearbygalaxies.",
    "ai_generated_text": "We present the first systematic investigation of the [Ne V] (14 μm/24 μm) and [S III] (18 μm/33 μm) mid‑infrared fine‑structure line ratios across a diverse sample of nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star‑forming galaxies, using archival spectroscopic data from the *Spitzer* Infrared Spectrograph. These line ratios are sensitive to electron density and ionization conditions in the narrow‑line region (NLR) and H II regions, providing robust diagnostics that are less affected by dust extinction compared to optical lines. We compile measurements for over 100 sources spanning a wide range of bolometric luminosities, host morphologies, and obscuration levels. Our analysis reveals distinct distributions for AGN versus purely star‑forming systems: [Ne V] ratios indicate systematically higher densities in AGN NLRs, while [S III] ratios exhibit broader variation likely reflecting contributions from both compact nuclear regions and extended star formation. We investigate potential biases due to aperture effects, calibration uncertainties, and contamination from low‑ionization gas. Comparison with photoionization models suggests that observed deviations from theoretical low‑density limits may be linked to temperature gradients or density stratification within emitting regions. These findings establish mid‑infrared line ratios as reliable tools for disentangling ionizing sources in dusty environments and provide constraints for next‑generation IR facilities targeting galaxy evolution in the obscured universe."
