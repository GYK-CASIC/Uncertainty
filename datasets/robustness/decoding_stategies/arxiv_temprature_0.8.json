In the first one, we derivethe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theoryand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit.

    "ai_generated_text": "A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation, has gained some attention in recent years due to its relevance in loop quantum gravity and related approaches to quantum cosmology. Unlike the standard Schrödinger representation, the polymer framework employs a discrete topology on configuration space, leading to a fundamentally different kinematical structure where momentum operators are not densely defined and must be replaced by suitable exponentiated shift operators. This representation exhibits features akin to lattice quantization, introducing a minimal length scale that can modify the dynamics of quantum systems at high energies. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the polymer representation for simple mechanical systems, focusing on the harmonic oscillator and free particle cases. We discuss the construction of the Hilbert space, the definition of basic operators, and the emergence of modified dispersion relations. Furthermore, we explore the semiclassical limit and the conditions under which polymer quantization reproduces standard quantum mechanics, highlighting regimes where measurable deviations could appear. Our results provide a unified perspective on the physical implications of polymer quantization, offering insights into how discrete structures could manifest in low-energy quantum experiments."

Anadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identifiedfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets ofresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties withthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modelingof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objectsexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit withactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possiblydebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extendsdown to at least a few x.001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's fromextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's aremore highly clustered than the later stages and that the backgroundextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation functionas seen in other extra-galactic studies.

Our analysis reveals a high surface density of protostars concentrated along dense molecular filaments, with evidence of ongoing clustered star formation. We find that the relative numbers of sources in different evolutionary stages are consistent with a young, dynamically evolving region, with a significant fraction of deeply embedded objects indicative of recent star formation activity. The mid-infrared data also allow us to detect extended emission from shocked gas and photodissociation regions, highlighting the interaction between young stars and their natal environment. Combining photometric classification with spatial mapping, we present an updated census of the Serpens population, providing constraints on star formation efficiency, timescales, and environmental influences.

Spin-modulated radialvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the firsttime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed thetheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) andNorton et al.

Evidencefor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya ispresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta andhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at theouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow ofmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) andclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with theaccretion curtain model.",

Time-resolved optical spectra reveal periodic changes consistent with the white dwarf’s spin period, indicating alternating visibility of accretion curtains as the magnetic poles rotate into and out of view. Doppler tomography of prominent emission lines, including Hα and He II 4686, shows persistent high-velocity components likely associated with stream–disk overflow, as well as lower-velocity structures near the outer disk. Comparison between the two epochs highlights subtle but significant changes in the relative strengths of the spin-modulated and orbital components, suggesting long-term variability in mass-transfer rate or magnetic field configuration. The absence of strong outburst signatures supports a stable accretion regime, yet line profile asymmetries imply ongoing non-axisymmetric flow. These results refine models of IP systems by illustrating how spectroscopic diagnostics across decades can reveal both stable and evolving features in the accretion process. The analysis underscores the value of multi-epoch phase-resolved spectroscopy in disentangling contributions from the disk, magnetically guided streams, and the accretion regions on the white dwarf surface."

We construct the integrators using a local coordinate-free representation based on the exponential map and stochastic flows, enabling treatment of Stratonovich-type equations with multiplicative noise. Order conditions are derived from a stochastic Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff expansion adapted to non-commuting vector fields. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the methods for problems in rigid body dynamics with random perturbations, stochastic flows on Lie groups, and stochastic attitude estimation. In all cases, the Lie group integrators exhibit superior long-time stability and geometric fidelity compared to standard stochastic Runge–Kutta schemes, particularly in the presence of strong noise and highly non-commuting drift and diffusion terms.

The model also suggeststhat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided byALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the coolgas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models ofthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations ofthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) revealsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longerperiods in network regions.

Here we present a comprehensive investigation combining high-resolution spectroscopic observations with advanced magnetohydrodynamic simulations to probe the interplay between magnetic fields, plasma flows, and radiative processes in the chromosphere. Using data from recent ground-based and space-borne instruments, we analyze fine-scale features such as fibrils, spicules, and shock fronts, resolving spatial scales down to a few tens of kilometers and temporal variations on the order of seconds. The observations are interpreted through numerical models incorporating realistic solar atmospheric stratification and non-equilibrium ionization effects, allowing us to reproduce key signatures of chromospheric heating and wave propagation. We find that intermittent magnetic reconnection, driven by small-scale flux emergence and cancellation, contributes significantly to localized energy deposition, while upward-propagating magneto-acoustic waves modulate the thermal structure and dynamics. Our results suggest that the chromosphere operates as a highly dynamic interface where magnetic and acoustic energy are continuously exchanged, challenging simplified static representations. This work advances the quantitative understanding of chromospheric variability and provides constraints for future multi-wavelength campaigns aimed at linking photospheric drivers to coronal heating."

We introduce several classes of limiters, including fixed-threshold, adaptive, and monotonic entropy filters, each designed to balance numerical stability and accuracy. The method is compatible with standard single-relaxation-time and multiple-relaxation-time LBM schemes, and can be tuned to target specific ranges of Mach numbers or Reynolds numbers. Benchmark tests on canonical problems—such as shock tube flows, lid-driven cavity, and shear layers—demonstrate significant reductions in post-shock oscillations and improved stability in under-resolved simulations.

A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating.

Comparative analysis with in-situ and remote observations – e.g., solar wind spacecraft data and interstellar scintillation measurements – demonstrates consistency with observed anisotropies and spectral breaks. This unified approach establishes a basis for interpreting turbulence-driven transport, particle acceleration, and magnetic reconnection in diverse astrophysical systems, and provides testable predictions for next-generation missions and high-resolution numerical simulations.

We introduce and investigate globally defined geometric structures that arise from specific curvature and torsion constraints, focusing on classes of Finsler manifolds endowed with distinguished connections whose properties are preserved under smooth transformations. Our approach unifies local and global perspectives, leveraging differential geometric techniques to characterize the interplay between metric, connection, and curvature tensors. In particular, we study generalized Berwald and Landsberg manifolds within a global framework, offering conditions under which these structures admit canonical foliations or decompositions. The paper develops new invariants to capture subtle geometric features, and explores their stability under deformations of the Finsler metric. Furthermore, we analyze the role of holonomy groups in determining the global topology of special Finsler spaces, and provide examples illustrating how these geometric constraints influence geodesic behavior and volume growth. The results extend and globalize several local classification theorems, bridging gaps between abstract theory and applications in variational problems, theoretical physics, and information geometry. This work lays the foundation for further studies on the global analysis of Finsler manifolds with special geometric properties."

We find that clusters with higher ρ_h exhibit a GCMF peak at larger masses, consistent with reduced mass-loss rates from two-body relaxation over their lifetimes, while low-ρ_h clusters show a lower peak mass, indicative of more significant dynamical evolution and stellar escape. The high-mass tail of the GCMF appears relatively insensitive to ρ_h, suggesting that early cluster formation and initial mass function shape are the dominant factors in that regime. Our results are well reproduced by dynamical models incorporating initial mass-dependent dissolution timescales modulated by density-dependent relaxation processes.

We demonstrate the property for both bosonic and fermionic sectors, showing that the kinematics and leading-order interactions coincide across a wide class of models, including higher-spin extensions and supersymmetric theories. The universality stems from the decoupling of transverse curvature effects and the simplification of covariant derivatives in the pp-wave limit. Possible implications include simplifications in holographic dualities, high-energy scattering in gravitational backgrounds, and the classification of consistent interaction vertices. Our results suggest that pp-wave backgrounds serve as a unifying framework in which diverse covariant field theories share identical local dynamics."

Artificial optical structures exhibiting localized high‐intensity emission regions were investigated under controlled excitation conditions to elucidate the mechanisms driving this phenomenon. Spectral analysis revealed narrowband peaks superimposed on a broadband background, with emission wavelengths dependent on structural periodicity and excitation geometry. Energetic measurements indicated efficient conversion of pump energy into coherent output, with localized hotspots contributing disproportionately to the overall emission. Temporal characterization, performed using high‐speed photodetectors and time‐correlated photon counting, demonstrated sub‐nanosecond rise times and complex decay dynamics, suggesting the interplay of resonant cavity effects and nonlinear scattering processes. The observed photonic flame effect was correlated with microstructural features, including defect‐mediated light localization and plasmonic enhancement in composite materials. These findings provide insight into tailoring artificial optical media for controlled emission profiles, with potential applications in photonic sensors, compact light sources, and optical communication devices. The combined spectral, energetical, and temporal dataset offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and exploiting the photonic flame effect in engineered systems, paving the way for novel designs that leverage localized optical energy concentration and ultrafast emission dynamics."

Experimental studies were conducted on high-quality ruby single-crystal resonators at cryogenic temperatures, enabling precise measurement of mode competition and spectral evolution. Numerical modeling based on coupled rate equations and nonlinear interaction terms reproduced key features observed in the experiments, including mode switching, self-organized spectral narrowing, and long-lived transient states. The results reveal that periodic modulation induces large-scale spectral rearrangements and correlated intensity oscillations across multiple modes, indicative of collective behavior in the phonon field.

Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

    "ai_generated_text": "The extraction of a physical law y = y₀(x) from joint experimental data about x and y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability distributions are analyzed to determine functional dependencies between the variables in the presence of measurement noise and finite sampling. A statistical framework is developed in which the joint distribution P(x, y) is first estimated from the experimental dataset using nonparametric density estimation. From this, the marginal distributions P(x) and P(y) are obtained, allowing the conditional distribution P(y | x) to be computed. The conditional mean provides an estimator for y₀(x), while the conditional variance quantifies uncertainty in the inferred law. The method integrates kernel-based smoothing with bias–variance trade-off optimization to robustly reconstruct the underlying physical relationship even for irregular or sparse data. The approach is demonstrated on synthetic datasets with known analytic forms and on real experimental measurements from a nonlinear dynamical system, illustrating its capacity to recover functional laws and associated confidence intervals. This probabilistic formulation generalizes traditional curve-fitting by explicitly accounting for stochastic fluctuations and correlations, enabling more reliable inference of governing physical laws from joint data in experimental physics and applied sciences."

Traditional approaches, while accurate, can be computationally expensive and difficult to scale for large data sets produced by current and upcoming facilities. In this work, we present a flexible and computationally efficient framework that combines non-LTE (non–local thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer calculations with machine learning–based emulators to accelerate parameter estimation from multi-line spectra. Our method leverages a precomputed grid of radiative transfer models to train supervised regressors capable of interpolating in high-dimensional parameter spaces while preserving physical consistency. We validate the approach using synthetic data and archival observations of molecular clouds, demonstrating that the emulators can recover key parameters within a few percent of full-model solutions, at a fraction of the computational cost. The framework is designed to be modular, enabling integration with Bayesian inference tools for robust uncertainty quantification. This combination of physics-based modeling and statistical learning is well-suited for the analysis of upcoming surveys, facilitating rapid interpretation of large spectral data sets in the context of star formation, galaxy evolution, and astrochemistry."

Simulations were performed across a temperature range from 100 K to 1200 K to capture both low-temperature stability regimes and high-temperature degradation phenomena. Results indicate that increasing temperature leads to progressive softening of axial Young’s modulus, with notable reductions observed beyond 800 K due to enhanced atomic vibrations and disruption of lattice registry between adjacent layers. Structural integrity is maintained up to a critical temperature threshold, after which radial expansion and interlayer sliding become prominent, diminishing load-bearing capacity. Analysis of radial distribution functions and potential energy profiles reveals that thermally induced instabilities are primarily driven by the weakening of π–π stacking forces between concentric shells.

Our Spitzer censusof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatiallywith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster arounda B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster peripheryabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We findthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with thatrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar populationindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show thatthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by itssmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. Whileit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result ofdynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findingssupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smallersub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that thesupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud shouldnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.",

Our Spitzer census, supplemented by ground-based spectra, has enabled a comprehensive characterization of the cluster’s young stellar population, circumstellar environments, and spatial distribution. Using deep IRAC and MIPS imaging, we have identified new candidate members based on infrared excess emission indicative of disks and envelopes, extending the known membership into lower-mass regimes and highly embedded sources invisible at optical wavelengths. Spectroscopic follow-up has allowed us to confirm youth and determine spectral types, facilitating robust estimates of stellar masses and ages. The combined dataset reveals a diversity of evolutionary stages within the cluster, from Class 0/I protostars to disk-bearing Class II sources and diskless Class III stars, with a spatial gradient suggesting sequential or triggered star formation. We analyze the fraction of sources exhibiting infrared excess as a function of age and location, finding evidence for disk dispersal over a few Myr timescales. The nebular mid-infrared emission traces filamentary structures consistent with ongoing star formation in the surrounding molecular cloud. Our results provide a complete inventory of IC 348 members detectable in the infrared, offering key constraints on cluster formation history and early stellar evolution."

Here we analyze the performance ofRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selectedfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributedentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examplesshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is onlyslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matchedfilter can require significantly more feedback.",

Such precoding can significantly enhance spectral efficiency, reduce inter-stream interference, and improve link reliability, especially in systems with limited or imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). This paper investigates a feedback-assisted precoding framework under practical constraints, including quantized feedback, time-varying channels, and correlated antenna arrays. We develop a stochastic optimization approach that jointly considers feedback rate allocation and precoder design to maximize the achievable rate subject to latency and complexity limits. Analytical bounds are derived for the performance gap between perfect and imperfect CSIT, highlighting the trade-offs between feedback resolution and channel coherence time. Simulation results for various antenna configurations and mobility scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-optimal throughput with substantially reduced feedback overhead compared to conventional schemes. The framework is extensible to both single-user and multi-user MIMO settings, and is particularly suitable for next-generation wireless systems where adaptive, low-latency beamforming is critical.

Spectral index measurements derived from matched-resolution maps indicate a predominantly non-thermal synchrotron origin, with modest spatial variation that may trace differences in particle acceleration efficiency or magnetic field strength. Polarimetric observations further reveal ordered magnetic fields aligned with the shell boundaries, consistent with compression by a strong outward-propagating shock.

In the most central events, the recoil jet structure is significantly broadened and, in some cases, exhibits a double-peaked or flattened profile compared to the narrow back-to-back peak observed in smaller systems. This behavior is commonly attributed to strong partonic energy loss and possible medium response effects, including Mach-cone–like shock waves or collective flow deflections, arising from the formation of a strongly coupled quark–gluon plasma. By analyzing azimuthal angular correlations between high-transverse-momentum trigger particles and associated hadrons, we quantify the evolution of the away-side topology as a function of collision centrality and transverse momentum. Comparisons with $pp$ and d+Au reference measurements allow for isolation of genuine final-state medium effects from initial-state nuclear modifications. The data reveal a systematic suppression of the away-side yield and enhanced low-$p_T$ particle production at large angles, consistent with scenarios involving redistribution of lost energy into softer hadrons.

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subclusterwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions ofthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionlessgalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on theself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, usingsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, andcomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow fora new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observationof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. Thisnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. Ifwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equalmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringentconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of thesubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with theuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of darkmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slightimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules outmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between thestandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.",

High-resolution X-ray data provide constraints on the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium, while strong and weak lensing reconstructions yield precise maps of the projected total mass distribution. Optical spectroscopy and photometry further probe galaxy kinematics and stellar populations, enabling a multi-faceted characterization of the cluster environment. We compare these observational constraints with hydrodynamical and N-body simulations incorporating realistic baryonic physics, including cooling, feedback, and star formation, to assess the level of agreement between theory and data. Discrepancies in core mass profiles, subhalo abundance, and gas fractions are discussed in the context of possible systematic effects and limitations of current physical models. Our results highlight that while overall mass scaling relations are broadly consistent, detailed structural properties often deviate from simulation predictions, indicating the need for improved treatments of feedback and non-thermal processes in cluster simulations.

Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates ina spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on theother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b.

Results: Our sample reveals distinct trends in planet occurrence and system architecture correlated with host mass: massive stars preferentially host giant planets at wider separations, whereas low-mass stars more often host compact, multi-planet systems of smaller worlds. We find evidence for a transition in planet formation efficiency near ~1.5 M☉, consistent with core accretion predictions modified by disk lifetimes and migration processes.

Using adaptive mesh refinement and realistic equations of state, we quantify the efficiency of envelope ejection as a function of mass ratio, initial separation, and envelope structure. Our results show that angular momentum transport is dominated by large-scale spiral shocks, while envelope unbinding depends sensitively on the interplay between orbital energy release and recombination energy within the gas. We find that post-common-envelope separations can vary by more than an order of magnitude for otherwise similar systems, underscoring the importance of detailed microphysics in predictive modeling.

Potential applications include simplified path-integral formulations, new approaches to scattering amplitudes involving massive spinning states, and geometric insights into spinor–helicity methods. This unified perspective not only broadens the scope of twistor theory, but also provides a powerful toolset for exploring the interplay between space-time symmetries and internal spin in relativistic particle physics."

We use anelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles thanearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the centralregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of aslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by acentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant thatmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamicstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellarevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled byneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, andthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effectiveaccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretionof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of doubleCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply thatat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered goodcandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 M⊙ primary and a 0.6 M⊙ secondary is investigated using high-resolution smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations, coupled with a detailed nuclear reaction network to capture thermonuclear processes. We focus on the pre-merger orbital decay driven by gravitational-wave emission, the tidal disruption of the secondary, and the subsequent mass transfer phase. Our models reveal that the merger proceeds through rapid accretion onto the primary, forming a hot, differentially rotating remnant surrounded by a dense accretion disk. Peak temperatures in the shear layers exceed 1×10⁹ K, initiating localized carbon burning that may influence the remnant’s stability. Post-merger evolution is followed for several dynamical timescales to assess whether conditions are sufficient for a prompt detonation or delayed ignition. We find that the outcome is sensitive to the initial mass ratio and angular momentum distribution, with lower-mass secondaries favoring disk-dominated remnants and higher-mass companions yielding more centrally concentrated structures. Our results have implications for the progenitor scenarios of Type Ia supernovae, the formation of massive single white dwarfs, and gravitational-wave signatures from compact binary mergers. These findings provide a quantitative framework for interpreting upcoming multi-messenger observations of double-degenerate systems."

This paper revisits the theoretical foundations of the single-index framework, emphasizing its statistical efficiency, robustness, and adaptability to modern data challenges such as sparsity, heteroskedasticity, and non-Gaussian noise. We propose a novel estimation procedure that integrates penalized likelihood techniques with kernel-based smoothing, producing consistent estimators even under weakened regularity conditions. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are derived, including convergence rates and bias–variance trade-offs. Simulation studies demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional estimation methods, particularly in scenarios with limited samples and correlated predictors. Furthermore, an application to a real-world dataset illustrates the method’s practical utility in uncovering complex structural patterns while preserving interpretability.

The data reveal signatures of both circumbinary disk truncation and ongoing accretion onto the stellar components, suggesting that gas streams penetrate the cleared cavities via dynamical channels modulated by the binary’s gravitational potential. By comparing hydrodynamic models with observed spectral energy distributions and emission line profiles, we constrain the mass transfer rates and identify the role of eccentricity in regulating disk–binary interactions. Our results indicate that, for systems with moderate eccentricities, pulsed accretion can occur near periastron, leading to temporal variability in accretion diagnostics. The observed flow structures are consistent with predictions of spiral streamers feeding circumstellar disks, even in the presence of substantial cavity clearing.

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the directmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, forboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes itstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-typegalaxies alike.

This analysis did not require themodification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a fivedimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle ofconservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value ofar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely onkey cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitationalconstant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law ofgravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary betweena four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking thespeed of light to the mass of the Universe.",
    "ai_generated_text": "The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors. In that work, the additional dimension was treated as orthogonal to the conventional four-dimensional space-time and associated with a cosmological-scale curvature radius. Building on those results, the present study extends the mathematical framework to include relativistic corrections, non-Keplerian perturbations, and the influence of varying curvature scale over cosmological time. The modified equations of motion are derived from a generalized metric that incorporates the fifth dimension, yielding analytical expressions for deviations from Newtonian orbital parameters. Numerical simulations are performed for planetary, satellite, and binary star systems, comparing the model predictions with high-precision ephemerides and observational data. Results indicate that the fifth-dimensional term introduces small but measurable secular variations in orbital elements, particularly in systems with high eccentricity or long periods. Implications for spacecraft navigation, long-term orbital stability, and tests of gravitational theory are discussed. The findings support the hypothesis that large-scale geometric extensions of space-time can subtly influence local orbital mechanics, offering a potential link between astrophysical observations and cosmological geometry beyond the standard four-dimensional framework."

The films were formed under controlled tribological conditions to simulate practical machine component interfaces, and their morphology was assessed via focused ion beam sectioning and transmission electron microscopy. The results reveal a stratified architecture consisting of a dense, phosphate-rich tribolayer adjacent to the steel substrate, overlain by a more compliant, amorphous outer region incorporating degraded ZDDP reaction products and iron oxides. Nanoindentation and lateral force measurements indicate that the mechanical response of the films varies markedly with depth: the inner layer exhibits high hardness and shear resistance, while the outer layer demonstrates viscoelastic behavior under oscillatory loading. These rheological characteristics are correlated with the film’s chemical composition and microstructure, and are shown to influence the wear-protection efficiency under mixed lubrication regimes. The findings provide insight into the mechanistic role of ZDDP-derived tribofilms in reducing wear and prolonging component lifetime, and suggest that tailoring the multi-layered architecture through additive formulation and operating conditions could optimize performance in demanding tribological applications."

The method allows the separation of contributions from pinning centers, thermal activation, and collective vortex creep, providing quantitative estimates for characteristic relaxation times. Experimental results reveal distinct regimes: at low temperatures, relaxation is dominated by strong pinning and minimal thermal fluctuations, whereas near the critical temperature pronounced vortex mobility leads to faster decay of induced perturbations.

Furthermore, we provide a refined analytical framework to approximate bit-error-rate (BER) performance using union bounds adapted to partially systematic code structures. The findings suggest that careful design of the systematic-to-parity ratio can yield coding gains of up to 0.3 dB at low BER targets, without significantly increasing decoding complexity. These insights open avenues for tailored PCCC designs in applications such as deep-space communications and low-latency wireless systems, where trade-offs between performance, complexity, and robustness are critical."

The gap magnitude, estimated from the optical spectra, agrees with activation energies extracted from dc transport. Additional vibrational structures, arising from electron–molecule coupling, are enhanced in the insulating phase, suggesting increased localization of carriers.

Temperature profiles were measured using fine thermocouples with radiative corrections applied. The addition of unsaturated C₃ hydrocarbons significantly altered the concentration gradients of key intermediates such as acetylene, ethylene, and propargyl radicals, which are known precursors to aromatic ring formation. Comparative analysis revealed that both allene and propyne dopants enhanced the early production of C₆H₆, suggesting accelerated pathways toward polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation.

The “high temperature” regime corresponds to parameter ranges in which type-switching is sufficiently rapid to induce effective homogenization over long time scales. We establish precise asymptotics for the total population size, spatial spread, and type distribution in this regime, using spine techniques and spectral analysis of the associated type-motion generator. Our results clarify the role of the principal eigenvalue in determining both the exponential growth rate and the limiting shape of the population profile. In particular, we identify explicit criteria separating high and intermediate temperature behaviour, and show that in the high temperature case, fluctuations in type composition vanish in the large-time limit.

We obtain analytic expressions for the time derivatives of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination, revealing couplings between quadrupolar asymmetry and gravitational-wave backreaction that modify inspiral trajectories relative to the spherically symmetric case. Notably, the interaction between the quadrupole moment and the radiation reaction leads to precession of the orbital plane and a modest shift in the rate of eccentricity damping, effects that could be significant for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals into deformed compact objects.

Andbecause the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute thesuperpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness ofgeometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced. In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case ofdeforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Modelcontent.

We focus specifically on the controlled deformation of singularities within Calabi–Yau manifolds, aiming to generate consistent gauge theory sectors with desired phenomenological properties. By systematically applying techniques from toric geometry and singularity resolution, we investigate how complex structure moduli can be tuned to produce smooth transitions between different gauge symmetry phases. In particular, we analyze the interplay between local singularity deformations and global consistency conditions such as anomaly cancellation and flux quantization. The results demonstrate that such deformations can be parameterized in a way that preserves supersymmetry while enabling targeted changes in the matter spectrum. We provide explicit examples illustrating how specific ADE-type singularities can be engineered and subsequently deformed to yield novel low-energy effective theories. Our approach also offers a framework for exploring transitions between distinct geometric phases in the moduli space, with implications for both model building and the study of string dualities. These findings open pathways for constructing richer phenomenological models directly from geometric principles."

One of the central issues addressed is how local dynamics—implemented via unitary evolution, noisy channels, or measurement-induced operations—can alter the global quantum correlations in a bipartite system. We present analytically solvable scenarios in which a single-qubit interaction modifies the joint state, leading to non-monotonic behavior in standard entanglement measures such as concurrence. By considering both pure and mixed initial states, we highlight the dependence of entanglement change on the choice of local operation, the initial state’s Schmidt decomposition, and the presence of decoherence. In particular, we identify conditions under which local interactions counterintuitively increase entanglement, thereby challenging naïve interpretations of the locality principle. Conversely, we demonstrate cases where entanglement is diminished, illustrating the sensitivity of quantum correlations to local perturbations. These examples serve to clarify subtle aspects of entanglement dynamics relevant to quantum communication and control, and they offer insight into resource manipulation in distributed quantum systems. The results underscore the importance of understanding local-global interplay in realistic quantum architectures, where control over subsystems is often the only available means of engineering desired correlations."

The data were obtained under excellent atmospheric conditions, allowing precise calibration and robust background subtraction. Modeling the spectral energy distribution, incorporating existing optical to mid-infrared photometry, indicates a dust temperature of approximately 40 K and a disk mass on the order of a few Earth masses, assuming standard dust opacities.

A key issue examined is thedetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is oftenempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrumfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering).

The transition is accompanied by a shift in the balance between accretion-driven growth and feedback-driven dispersal, with radiative and mechanical feedback from early massive stars suppressing further high-mass formation in the low-density regime.

    "ai_generated_text": "We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model designed to explore the statistical mechanics of deformable membranes with fluctuating connectivity. The model is based on dynamically triangulated meshes embedded in three-dimensional space, where vertices interact via a combination of bending energy and an intrinsic area term. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the tubular phase emerges through spontaneous symmetry breaking when anisotropic fluctuations dominate, producing elongated, quasi-one-dimensional structures. The planar phase corresponds to configurations with large aspect ratios and minimal curvature, stabilized by a balance between entropic stretching and bending rigidity. The spherical phase appears at high bending stiffness, where curvature is uniformly distributed and the topology remains isotropic. We perform finite-size scaling analyses to quantify the order parameters and identify transition points, finding evidence for both continuous and discontinuous transitions depending on parameter regimes. The results demonstrate how connectivity fluctuations in triangulated fluid surfaces can give rise to rich morphological behavior, with potential relevance to biophysical membranes, soft matter systems, and the statistical geometry of fluctuating surfaces. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of phase structure in models bridging geometry and statistical physics."

The superconductor contains percolating networks of superconducting regions interspersed with normal-phase inclusions whose boundaries exhibit fractal geometry. Such fractal boundaries strongly influence the pinning characteristics of magnetic vortices, modifying both the spatial distribution of pinning sites and the statistical properties of depinning events. We develop a phenomenological model that relates the fractal dimension of cluster interfaces to the scaling of the critical current and the resistive transition under applied magnetic fields. Numerical simulations based on percolation theory and Langevin dynamics reveal that increased boundary fractality enhances vortex trapping by creating extended, irregular pinning landscapes, leading to a broader distribution of depinning currents. Experimental implications include a possible explanation for anomalous broadening of current-voltage characteristics observed in high-temperature superconductors with intrinsic inhomogeneities. The results suggest that controlled introduction of fractal normal-phase clusters could be used to engineer pinning efficiency without significantly reducing the superconducting volume fraction.

We argue thatdifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust inthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limitand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of thetorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount ofextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the lineratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densitiesassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. Wealso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extendedand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission fromlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios fromsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearbygalaxies.",
    "ai_generated_text": "We present the first systematic investigation of the [Ne V] (14 μm / 24 μm) and [S III] (18 μm / 33 μm) mid-infrared fine-structure line ratios in a diverse sample of nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies observed with *Spitzer* IRS and *JWST* MIRI. These ratios are widely used as diagnostics of electron density, ionization conditions, and potential dust extinction in ionized gas regions, yet detailed statistical characterization across different environments has been lacking. Our study combines archival spectra with new high-sensitivity observations, enabling consistent measurement of line fluxes with uniform calibration and background subtraction. We explore correlations between the observed ratios and independent tracers of AGN luminosity, star formation rate, and host galaxy morphology. We find that [Ne V] ratios in AGN-dominated systems are generally consistent with densities of 10³–10⁴ cm⁻³, while [S III] ratios span a broader range reflecting mixed contributions from H II regions and diffuse ionized gas. Deviations from theoretical low-density limits are common and can be attributed to moderate dust extinction or temperature gradients within the emitting regions. Our results provide updated empirical constraints for infrared diagnostic models and highlight the importance of multi-line analysis to disentangle radiation field hardness, density structure, and extinction effects in complex galactic environments."
