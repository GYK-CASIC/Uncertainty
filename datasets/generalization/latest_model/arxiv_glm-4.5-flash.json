    "ai_generated_text": "A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation, has gained some attention in recent years due to its potential applications in quantum gravity and cosmology. This approach replaces the usual continuous Hilbert space with a discrete, non-differentiable structure, characterized by a minimal length scale, which arises from the underlying polymerization of the phase space. Unlike standard quantum mechanics, the polymer representation exhibits a fundamental discreteness that mimics features of loop quantum gravity, offering a natural framework to resolve singularities in cosmological models. Recent studies have explored its implications for quantum field theory, revealing deviations from standard commutation relations and introducing novel regularization techniques for divergent expressions. However, challenges persist, including the formulation of consistent dynamics and the preservation of unitarity in polymer quantum mechanics. Advances in numerical simulations and analytical approximations have provided insights into its phenomenological consequences, particularly in early-universe scenarios. While promising, the polymer representation remains a subject of active research, bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and discrete spacetime structures. Future work aims to refine its mathematical foundations and test its predictions against observational cosmology."

These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s.

The He II λ4686 line exhibits double-peaked profiles with phase-dependent intensity and velocity shifts, indicative of an accretion curtain extending from the WD surface to the magnetospheric radius.

This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic behaviors, including ultrasensitivity, bistability, and oscillations, which are critical for precise cellular decision-making.

Mathematical modeling, particularly through ordinary differential equations, reveals that increasing the number of sites enhances ultrasensitivity, enabling switch-like responses to graded signals. Concurrently, negative feedback can induce damped or sustained oscillations, while positive feedback may stabilize bistable states. These behaviors arise from the interplay between kinase and phosphatase activities, substrate cooperativity, and time delays inherent in enzymatic reactions. Importantly, multisite phosphorylation acts as a computational module, allowing cells to integrate and amplify external cues into complex outputs. Disruptions in these cycles are linked to pathologies such as cancer and metabolic disorders, underscoring their functional significance.

We systematically assess DDA’s performance for particles spanning sizes from 10 to 100 wavelengths, comparing results against exact analytical solutions and rigorous electromagnetic solvers. Our analysis reveals that DDA maintains high accuracy for size parameters up to approximately 60, provided dipole spacing is appropriately refined (typically < λ/10). Beyond this, computational costs escalate quadratically, and errors in far-field scattering and absorption cross-sections become significant due to discretization artifacts and convergence issues. We demonstrate that adaptive dipole placement and optimized iterative solvers can partially mitigate these effects, but inherent limitations emerge for very large particles. This work provides critical benchmarks and guidelines for DDA users, highlighting its robustness for moderately large particles while underscoring the need for complementary methods (e.g., geometric optics or hybrid approaches) in the extreme size regime.

We introduce and investigate globally defined structures that extend the classical notion of Finsler metrics while preserving their intrinsic geometric properties. Our approach establishes a unified framework for studying manifolds equipped with special Finsler metrics, focusing particularly on their curvature properties, geodesic flows, and variational principles. We develop a comprehensive theory of connections and parallel transport on these spaces, demonstrating how they differ from their Riemannian counterparts. The paper presents new results on the existence and uniqueness of special Finsler structures on compact manifolds with boundary, and establishes fundamental comparison theorems relating their geometric invariants. We investigate the interplay between special Finsler metrics and symplectic geometry, revealing novel connections between these seemingly distinct mathematical domains. Applications to mathematical physics, particularly in the context of generalized field theories, are discussed, highlighting the potential of our framework for modeling anisotropic phenomena.

We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

Energetical studies confirm radiative energy conversion efficiencies exceeding 60% under pulsed excitation, with non-Planckian spectral signatures indicating nonequilibrium thermal states. Temporal characterization demonstrates sub-picosecond rise times and nanosecond decay kinetics, governed by hybridized surface plasmon-polariton modes. Comparative simulations using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods align with empirical data, validating the photonic flame effect as a scalable platform for tailored thermal radiation. These findings enable applications in advanced photonic radiative cooling, tunable infrared sources, and biomimetic energy harvesting systems. The work establishes a universal framework for manipulating thermal radiation through structured optical media, bridging nanophotonics and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Future directions include dynamic tuning via external stimuli and integration with quantum emitters for hybrid optoelectronic devices."

It is derived directly from thekernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. Theproposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisychaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predicta future value of chaotic time series from the present one.

    "ai_generated_text": "Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by experimental data via a kernel, which transforms discrete observations into continuous representations. However, traditional kernel density estimation (KDE) faces challenges in high-dimensional physical systems, where the curse of dimensionality obscures underlying structures and inflates computational costs. This paper introduces a novel dimensionality-reduced kernel framework that leverages principal component analysis (PCA) to isolate dominant variance directions in complex experimental datasets. By projecting data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, the method mitigates overfitting while preserving critical physical correlations. Validation with simulated particle collision data demonstrates a 40% reduction in mean integrated squared error compared to standard KDE, alongside a 60% decrease in computational time. The approach is further applied to quantum tunneling measurements, revealing subtle resonance features obscured in conventional analyses. This framework bridges statistical robustness with physical interpretability, enabling precise extraction of fundamental laws from noisy, high-dimensional experimental outputs. Future work will extend the method to non-Gaussian kernels and incorporate domain-specific constraints to enhance model fidelity."

We consider the infall trajectories of the two subclusters towards their common center of mass under gravitational attraction, modeled as point masses incorporating both baryonic and dark matter components. Applying the timing argument formalism—which relates the relative velocity and separation of colliding systems to their total mass—we derive constraints on the dark matter fraction within the subclusters' cores. Our analysis assumes spherical symmetry and neglects detailed hydrodynamics, focusing on the collision dynamics dominated by gravitational interactions. We find that the timing arguments provide a robust upper limit on the dark matter fraction in the collision region, consistent with the majority of mass being non-baryonic. This limit, while less stringent than direct lensing measurements in the cluster outskirts, offers a complementary, dynamical probe sensitive to the mass distribution during the merger.

We demonstrate that double scattering processes, previously neglected in single-scattering approximations, induce significant medium-induced corrections to fragmentation functions. These corrections arise from both elastic and inelastic double scatterings, leading to distinct modifications for quarks and antiquarks due to their opposite color charges. The analysis reveals that double scattering causes a stronger suppression of high-momentum fragments compared to single scattering, with antiquark fragmentation exhibiting greater sensitivity due to their annihilation contributions. We quantify these effects by solving the evolution equations for fragmentation functions in the presence of a dense nuclear medium, incorporating double scattering as a leading-order correction. The results indicate that neglecting double scattering underestimates medium-induced quenching by approximately 15–20% at moderate to high energies, particularly for gluon-dominated jets. These findings underscore the importance of double scattering for precision studies of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions, such as those at the LHC and RHIC, and provide crucial insights for interpreting experimental data on nuclear modification factors and fragmentation observables."

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spina=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbitswhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respectto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact oppositeto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

Here, we present a deep learning framework that bridges this gap by training neural networks on synthetic spectra generated from non-LTE radiative transfer models. Our approach achieves unprecedented speed—orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods—while maintaining high accuracy across diverse astrophysical environments. The network architecture incorporates physically motivated constraints, ensuring robustness against observational noise and systematic biases. We validate the model against synthetic test sets and real observations of protoplanetary disks and star-forming regions, demonstrating reliable recovery of key parameters even in low signal-to-noise regimes. This technique enables rapid, scalable analysis of next-generation surveys (e.g., ALMA, JWST), facilitating the exploration of chemical complexity in galaxies, star formation processes, and astrochemical networks. By democratizing access to sophisticated physical parameter inference, our method empowers researchers to harness the full potential of modern multiwavelength datasets, transforming big data into actionable astrophysical insights."

The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation ofthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information andinformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity ofthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experimentsneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the costfunction.

This redundancy, measured through mutual information or correlation coefficients, reveals inherent dependencies and constraints within the system. High redundancy indicates simpler, more predictable dynamics, requiring fewer experiments to characterize, while low redundancy signifies intricate, multi-factorial behavior necessitating extensive data collection. By analyzing redundancy, researchers identify critical dimensions of variation and minimize redundant measurements, optimizing resource allocation without sacrificing informational content. This approach bridges information theory with experimental design, enabling targeted data acquisition that maximizes knowledge gain per experiment. For instance, in biological systems, redundancy analysis can pinpoint redundant gene assays, reducing costs in high-throughput studies. Conversely, in complex physical phenomena like turbulent flows, low redundancy mandates dense sampling to capture emergent structures. Thus, redundancy serves as a pivotal metric for determining the experimentally accessible complexity, ensuring efficient exploration of systems across scientific disciplines.

At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January),X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\\rm X}$ $\\sim$ 2.4 $\\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergss$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-componentplane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. Asthe shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-rayremnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$than it was until 2004 ($v$ $\\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$).",

We present a review of its X-ray evolution over the past two decades, highlighting Chandra's unparalleled capabilities in resolving the complex remnant structure. Early observations revealed the striking three-ring nebula, dominated by circumstellar material interaction. Subsequent years tracked the rapid brightening and softening of the inner ring emission, signaling the ongoing shock breakout into the dense equatorial ring. Around 2011, a distinct central point source emerged, interpreted as the first direct evidence of the neutron star or its pulsar wind nebula, though its nature remains debated. The most recent epochs (2020-2024) show a dramatic transition: the X-ray luminosity is now dominated by the reverse shock interacting with the supernova ejecta, marking a critical phase in the remnant's evolution. Chandra's high spatial resolution has enabled detailed mapping of shock structures, knot evolution, and the changing morphology of the inner ring and central source. This long-term dataset provides crucial insights into the physics of supernova remnants, neutron star formation, and the interaction between stellar ejecta and the circumstellar environment, uniquely captured by Chandra's persistent view of SN 1987A."

Here we analyze the performance ofRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selectedfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributedentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examplesshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is onlyslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matchedfilter can require significantly more feedback.",
    "ai_generated_text": "Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, enabling significant gains in spectral efficiency and reliability. This paper addresses the challenge of designing efficient feedback mechanisms for large-scale MIMO systems under limited feedback constraints. We propose a novel quantization framework that leverages Grassmannian line packing to optimize the codebook structure for channel state information (CSI) quantization. The approach minimizes the chordal distance between the actual channel and its quantized version, thereby maximizing the achievable rate. Furthermore, we introduce a low-complexity precoding algorithm that selects the optimal beamforming vector from the codebook based on the quantized feedback, ensuring robust performance even with reduced feedback bits. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional random vector quantization and Grassmannian codebook designs, achieving near-optimal sum-rate with significantly lower overhead. Particularly, in massive MIMO configurations, the proposed scheme reduces feedback requirements by up to 40% while maintaining within 90% of the perfect CSI capacity. The framework is also extended to multi-user scenarios, enhancing user fairness and system throughput. These findings highlight the critical role of structured feedback design in realizing the full potential of MIMO communications in resource-constrained environments."

Such observations provide critical insights into the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions. The d+Au system, serving as a cold nuclear matter baseline, confirms that the observed effects in central Au+Au are primarily driven by the hot, dense medium, not initial-state effects.

Our main contribution establishes a novel family of asymptotic slice rank lower bounds for the permanent over finite fields, leveraging recent advances in the representation theory of general linear groups and the geometry of Grassmannians. These bounds demonstrate that the permanent polynomial cannot lie in the orbit closure of the determinant under the action of the general linear group, even after passing to asymptotic limits.

This concept, initially explored theoretically using transformation optics, involves mapping the electromagnetic properties of a region containing an object to those of empty space via a coordinate transformation, requiring spatially varying and often anisotropic material parameters. Significant progress has been made in realizing these exotic materials, termed metamaterials, primarily at microwave frequencies using resonant structures.

The wavelength intervalexplored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration timerender our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different statesof the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described inthe literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in theH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in theV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contraryto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights ofNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours.

By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS2155-304, we conducted a multiwavelength campaign spanning X-ray to gamma-ray energies, capturing its extreme spectral states. Data reveal significant, rapid shifts in the synchrotron peak frequency (from UV to X-ray bands) and correlated changes in the Compton dominance, challenging simplistic one-zone emission scenarios. During high-activity states, the spectrum exhibits a hardening with increasing flux, inconsistent with standard leptonic models invoking a single electron population. Instead, these findings support multi-zone or hybrid models, where distinct electron populations or inhomogeneous jet structures better account for the observed spectral evolution. The variability pattern further suggests a dominant role of external photon fields in the Comptonization process, particularly during flaring episodes. Our analysis underscores the necessity of incorporating dynamic jet physics and complex seed photon environments to reproduce the observed spectral behavior. Future high-cadence, broadband observations will refine these constraints, advancing our understanding of blazar emission mechanisms and their role in high-energy astrophysics."

The spectral energy distribution (SED) evolution during this period reveals significant variability across radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands, with notable flaring episodes. The optical and X-ray emissions exhibit strong, correlated variability, suggesting a common origin in the synchrotron process within the jet. Conversely, gamma-ray flares often lag behind optical/X-ray peaks, indicating a distinct emission component likely arising from inverse Compton scattering of external photons. The SEDs at different epochs show a characteristic double-peaked structure, with the peak frequencies shifting dramatically during flares, consistent with a shock-in-jet model. The low-energy peak (synchrotron) varies by a factor of ∼5 in flux and ∼0.5 dex in peak frequency, while the high-energy peak (inverse Compton) varies by a factor of ∼3. These results support a leptonic scenario where the jet is powered by relativistic electrons, and the observed variability is driven by changes in the electron energy distribution and Doppler factor.

Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period.

We present 3D hydrodynamical simulations of CE interactions with a 5 M⊙ asymptotic giant branch donor and a 1.4 M⊙ neutron star companion, resolving scales down to 10−3 R⊙. Our results reveal that the recombination energy of hydrogen in the envelope dominates the energy budget, providing a natural mechanism for envelope ejection without requiring extreme orbital energy extraction. Asymptotic analysis shows that the CE efficiency parameter αCE ∼ 0.3–0.5 aligns with recombination-dominated models, challenging traditional α-prescriptions. The companion’s tidal forces truncate the donor’s core, leading to asymmetric mass ejection and significant orbital decay.

We find that the overall binary fraction of acluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at latetimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in thecentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a corebinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining).

Results reveal that the binary fraction declines significantly over time, driven primarily by dynamical interactions and stellar evolution processes. Clusters with higher initial binary frequencies experience more rapid dissolution due to increased encounter rates, while lower initial fractions lead to slower but steady depletion. The evolution is sensitive to cluster mass and density, with more massive clusters retaining binary populations longer due to deeper potential wells. We find that primordial binaries significantly influence cluster structure, promoting mass segregation and delaying core collapse. Our models demonstrate that observed binary fractions in young clusters (∼1–10 Myr) closely reflect primordial values, but by ∼100 Myr, fractions can drop to 10–20% of initial levels.

A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedlesscone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones.

Our approach represents jets as topological graphs, with particles as nodes and geometric proximity as edges. By training GNNs on large-scale simulated datasets, we predict stable cone configurations directly from particle-level information, bypassing iterative procedures.

    "ai_generated_text": "We investigate the weak-field, post-Newtonian expansion to the solution of the field equations in Chern-Simons gravity with a perfect fluid. This theory extends general relativity by incorporating a parity-violating Chern-Simons term, which introduces a scalar field coupled to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. For a static, spherically symmetric perfect fluid source, we derive the metric and scalar field perturbations systematically in the post-Newtonian framework. We compute the metric coefficients up to the first post-Newtonian (1PN) order, revealing that the Chern-Simons term modifies the Newtonian potential and introduces additional scalar-field contributions. The analysis yields an effective gravitational constant that depends on the scalar field profile and fluid properties, leading to deviations from standard general relativity in the weak-field regime. We assess the constraints imposed by solar system tests, such as light deflection and perihelion precession, and find that current observations limit the Chern-Simons coupling strength. Our results provide a foundation for experimental probes of Chern-Simons gravity using precision gravitational measurements and highlight the role of perfect fluids in testing modified gravity theories."

Its flexibility in modeling nonlinear relationships without requiring full specification of the link function has made it invaluable across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine learning. However, traditional estimation methods, such as average derivative estimation or backfitting, often struggle with computational complexity and instability in ultra-high-dimensional settings, limiting scalability to contemporary big data challenges. This paper introduces a novel, scalable algorithm leveraging stochastic gradient descent with adaptive learning rates and coordinate descent techniques to enhance estimation efficiency and convergence. Our approach integrates a debiasing procedure to address bias-variance trade-offs, ensuring robustness even under model misspecification. Theoretical results establish uniform convergence rates and asymptotic normality under mild conditions. Empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in computational speed and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By providing a principled framework for large-scale single-index modeling, our work bridges critical gaps in high-dimensional nonparametric regression, enabling broader applications in science and industry."

We investigate this process through hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary disks, focusing on viscous accretion and gravitational torques. Our models reveal that while the binary's gravity efficiently clears a central cavity, material inflow persists along low-density channels near the disk midplane. This inflow is driven by pressure gradients and viscous stresses, allowing gas and dust to slowly refill the cleared region on timescales of 10,000–100,000 years. We find that the inflow rate scales with the disk's viscosity and binary separation, with higher-viscosity disks exhibiting enhanced mass transfer. Observational signatures of this process include asymmetric dust rings and azimuthal brightness variations, which we compare to ALMA data of young binary systems like GG Tau and HD 98800. Our results suggest that central holes in circumbinary disks are not static but dynamic features, with continuous material flow enabling planet formation within the cavity. This challenges the notion of completely evacuated gaps and implies that planets may form in these regions despite the binary's gravitational influence. Future high-resolution observations could directly probe these inflow channels, providing critical tests for our models."

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the directmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, forboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes itstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-typegalaxies alike.

Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, andintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the localmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-typegalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}.

Our calculations reveal that increasing asymmetry enhances the energy separation between the longitudinal and transverse modes, particularly at low momenta and sub-threshold energies. This splitting arises from the modification of the pion self-energy by the nuclear medium, driven by the density dependence of the scalar and vector mean fields. The results demonstrate that mode splitting significantly alters pion-nucleus dynamics, affecting in-medium pion production and absorption rates. These findings have critical implications for neutron star crusts, heavy-ion collision observables, and the interpretation of rare isotope experiments.

Local nano-frictionexperiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine theevolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure forthe different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressurein the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent frictioncoefficient is high ($\\mu$ > 0.4).

    "ai_generated_text": "The layered structure and the rheological properties of anti-wear films, generated in a rolling/sliding contact from lubricants containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), are critical for understanding the performance of lubricated mechanical systems. These films form complex, stratified architectures under tribological stress, comprising distinct phosphate-rich, sulfate, and oxide layers that evolve dynamically with shear and temperature. The top phosphate layer exhibits a viscoelastic response, characterized by a yield stress followed by shear-thinning behavior, which enables load-bearing and friction reduction. The underlying sulfate layer acts as a compliant substrate, facilitating stress distribution and preventing delamination. Rheological measurements reveal that the films exhibit time-dependent recovery, crucial for maintaining protective continuity during intermittent contact. Advanced in-situ techniques, such as atomic force microscopy and micro-rheology, confirm that the layered structure enhances wear resistance by minimizing shear localization at interfaces. However, thermal degradation above 150°C compromises the film’s integrity, leading to accelerated wear. This study demonstrates that optimizing ZDDP formulation and operating conditions can tailor film rheology for enhanced durability in high-stress applications like engine components, highlighting the synergy between nanoscale structure and macroscopic tribological performance."

This study addresses these gaps by developing a novel collision operator that enhances numerical stability while preserving second-order accuracy through a modified equilibrium distribution function. We demonstrate that our approach mitigates spurious oscillations near discontinuities and reduces sensitivity to relaxation parameters, as validated by benchmark simulations of lid-driven cavity flow and rising bubble dynamics. Comparative analyses reveal superior convergence rates and lower computational costs compared to standard LB schemes, with error reductions of up to 40% in vorticity fields. Theoretical stability bounds derived via discrete Fourier analysis confirm that the new operator maintains positivity and Galilean invariance across a wider parameter space. These findings provide a robust framework for simulating challenging industrial flows, including turbulent mixing and microfluidic transport, where traditional LB methods exhibit limitations. The proposed model thus bridges critical theoretical gaps and expands the applicability of LB methods to previously intractable regimes."

This instability arises due to the interplay between centrifugal forces and pressure gradients, leading to exponential growth of non-axisymmetric perturbations. Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we confirm that differentially rotating stars, characterized by a negative radial gradient of angular velocity, develop robust bar modes on dynamical timescales. The instability is driven by the Rayleigh criterion, which is violated when the angular momentum decreases outward, enhancing the susceptibility to fragmentation. Our results show that the critical rotation rate for instability is significantly lower in differentially rotating systems compared to uniformly rotating stars, challenging long-held assumptions about stellar stability. This has profound implications for astrophysical scenarios, such as the collapse of rapidly rotating stellar cores in supernovae or the evolution of neutron stars, where differential rotation may trigger gravitational wave emission and alter collapse dynamics. The findings underscore the need to incorporate differential rotation in stellar evolution models to accurately predict the outcomes of core collapse and the formation of compact objects."

Wave profiles exhibit spatial distortions, including amplitude modulation and phase mixing, which arise from density gradients that cause partial wave reflection and mode coupling. These effects are particularly pronounced in loops with steep density contrasts or fine-scale structuring, such as those observed in the transition region.

In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding toa ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames havebeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentrationprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after samplingwith a quartz microprobe.

The experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure under fuel-rich conditions (equivalence ratio φ = 1.3) using a flat-flame burner coupled with molecular beam mass spectrometry for in-situ species measurements. Detailed numerical simulations employing a validated comprehensive kinetic mechanism were performed to interpret the experimental data and elucidate the combustion chemistry. Results reveal significant differences in flame structure and reaction pathways due to doping. The pure methane flame exhibits a typical hydrocarbon oxidation profile, while allene doping enhances the formation of polyacetylene species (C4H2, C6H2) and increases the peak concentrations of key intermediates like C2H2 and HCCO. Propyne doping, in contrast, promotes higher levels of methyl radicals (CH3) and C3 hydrocarbons, altering the radical pool and heat release distribution. Kinetic analysis identifies allene as a precursor to benzene via the propargyl recombination pathway, whereas propyne favors propargyl-to-benzene isomerization. These findings underscore the critical role of unsaturated dopants in shaping flame chemistry, with implications for understanding soot formation and developing cleaner combustion strategies in practical systems."

By establishing a duality with a related measure-valued process, we derive the almost sure convergence of suitably scaled particle counts and genealogical structures to a deterministic limit. This limit exhibits a phase transition governed by the spectral properties of the underlying generator, revealing a universal scaling law for the population growth rate. Furthermore, we investigate the spatial distribution of particles, proving that the res empirical measure converges weakly to a Gaussian field with covariance structure determined by the branching kernel. Our results unify and extend classical findings for super-Brownian motion, providing a comprehensive description of the high temperature dynamics.

This framework captures the interplay between spin-induced quadrupolar effects and gravitational self-force corrections. We find that radiation reaction induces a secular precession of the orbital plane, distinct from the conservative quadrupole-driven precession, with a rate proportional to Q and the orbital energy flux. Additionally, the quadrupole moment modifies the standard quadrupole formula for energy and angular momentum loss, introducing corrections that depend on the relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momentum.

    "ai_generated_text": "A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth masses, addressing a critical gap in our understanding of planetary systems. Ground-based microlensing surveys are limited by terrestrial day-night cycles and atmospheric disturbances, restricting their sensitivity to short-duration events and low-mass planets. A space-based observatory, such as the planned Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, enables continuous, high-cadence monitoring of dense stellar fields like the Galactic bulge, capturing the full range of microlensing signatures. This approach uniquely probes planets at wide orbital separations (0.5–10 AU) and free-floating planets, complementing radial velocity and transit methods. By observing millions of stars, the survey will measure the planet mass function, orbital separation distribution, and frequency of free-floating planets across the bulge’s diverse stellar populations. These data will reveal the prevalence of Earth-mass analogs and gas giants beyond the ice line, testing core accretion and gravitational instability formation theories. The resulting catalog will be invaluable for exoplanet demographics studies, constraining models of planetary system architecture and evolution, and guiding future missions targeting habitable-zone worlds. This survey represents a transformative opportunity to map the uncharted exoplanet population at the low-mass, wide-separation frontier."

The analysis reveals that such interactions can steer the system between separable and entangled states, depending on the specific operation and initial conditions. These results challenge the intuitive notion that entanglement manipulation requires simultaneous access to both qubits. The study further explores the role of non-local correlations in enabling this phenomenon, highlighting how local operations can indirectly affect global entanglement structures. Implications for quantum information protocols are discussed, including potential applications in entanglement distillation and quantum error correction where targeted local control may optimize resource utilization.

A key issue examined is thedetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is oftenempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrumfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering).

Additionally, uncertainties in the distance, absorption, and contaminating emission from the companion star or jet complicate parameter extraction. We discuss how current spectral-timing approaches, such as modeling disk reflection features and quasi-periodic oscillations, offer constraints but remain sensitive to the assumed accretion flow physics (e.g., standard thin disk vs. advection-dominated flows). The emergence of high-resolution timing data from missions like NICER and future X-ray observatories provides new avenues, yet necessitates robust, self-consistent frameworks that unify disk, corona, and jet physics.

We find that for a given route, thedecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperativecoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable bythe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperativecoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in termsof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithmruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm thatruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route whenthe nodes transmit independent codewords.

We study different coding strategies in the single-source single-destination scenario, focusing on how relay nodes collaborate to enhance reliability and spectral efficiency. Our analysis considers both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, examining the impact of coding schemes such as repetition, distributed space-time block codes (DSTBCs), and network-coded cooperation. Through theoretical derivations and simulations, we evaluate outage probability, bit error rate (BER), and diversity gains under Rayleigh fading channels. Results demonstrate that DSTBCs achieve full spatial diversity while minimizing bandwidth overhead, though they require stringent synchronization. Network-coded cooperation significantly improves throughput in multi-relay setups by exploiting coding opportunities at the physical layer. We also derive optimal power allocation policies to balance energy consumption among source and relays, showing that cooperative diversity gains scale linearly with the number of relays but are constrained by relay node density and channel conditions. These insights provide guidelines for designing efficient cooperative systems in next-generation wireless networks, highlighting trade-offs between complexity, performance, and resource utilization."

Our model incorporates spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity, enabling the emergence of complex spatiotemporal patterns that sustain coexistence. Through extensive simulations and mean-field approximations, we identify critical parameter regimes where both species persist indefinitely. Coexistence arises from the interplay between localized prey clustering, predator-prey oscillations, and noise-driven dispersal, preventing competitive exclusion. We quantify stationary population distributions, correlation lengths, and entropy production rates to characterize stability. Results demonstrate that spatial structure and stochasticity are essential for maintaining biodiversity, as they disrupt homogeneous equilibria and facilitate dynamic refugia.

These systems feature a highly magnetized white dwarf (typically with surface fields of 1–10 MG) accreting matter from a low-mass companion star via an accretion disk, where the magnetic field channels the flow directly onto the stellar poles, truncating the disk. The resulting accretion columns produce X-ray and optical variability, with spin periods ranging from ∼33 minutes to ∼12 hours, distinct from the longer orbital periods (∼1.5–10 hours). IPs exhibit complex photometric and spectroscopic behavior, including quasi-periodic oscillations, superhumps, and cyclotron emission lines, providing insights into accretion physics and angular momentum evolution in close binaries. Their rotational spin-down rates offer constraints on magnetic braking and accretion torque mechanisms. Recent high-time-resolution X-ray and optical observations have revealed detailed accretion flow structures and shock dynamics, advancing theoretical models of magnetized accretion.

Specifically, we identify sentences independent of the standard axioms, such as those asserting the existence of atoms or the algebra's finiteness, which cannot be proven or refuted. This incompleteness arises from the inability of first-order logic to characterize Boolean algebras up to isomorphism, as shown by Löwenheim-Skolem theorems.

Our results reveal a stratified chemical structure, with warm COMs concentrated in a compact region (≈3000 AU) around the protostar, consistent with sublimation of icy mantles on dust grains. Column density ratios of COMs suggest non-LTE excitation and significant gas-phase formation pathways, such as radical-radical reactions, occurring at temperatures >100 K. Kinematic analysis of methanol emission indicates infall motions and a rotating disk, supporting a scenario where the hot core is fed by accretion from the surrounding envelope.

This paper introduces the notion of \"canonicalnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacitiescan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks.
