It is an area of science that spans many disciplines[which?], but at its core, it involves the development of models and simulations to understand natural systems.\nIn practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation from numerical analysis and theoretical computer science to solve problems in various scientific disciplines. The field is different from theory and laboratory experiments, which are the traditional forms of science and engineering. The scientific computing approach is to gain understanding through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers. Scientists and engineers develop computer programs and application software that model systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input parameters. The essence of computational science is the application of numerical algorithms and computational mathematics. In some cases, these models require massive amounts of calculations (usually floating-point) and are often executed on supercomputers or distributed computing platforms.[verification needed]",

It integrates mathematical models, numerical analysis, algorithms, and computer simulations to study phenomena that are difficult or impossible to examine analytically or experimentally. By leveraging high-performance computing systems, scientists can simulate intricate processes such as climate dynamics, molecular interactions, astrophysical events, and engineering designs with remarkable precision. This approach enables researchers to explore scenarios, optimize solutions, and predict outcomes before committing to costly physical experiments. Computational science acts as a bridge between theory and practice: mathematical theories provide the framework, algorithms translate these theories into computational steps, and computer hardware executes the simulations efficiently. Modern SC relies heavily on programming languages, parallel computing, and visualization tools to interpret vast amounts of generated data. As technology advances, computational science continues to expand its role in innovation, influencing fields like medicine, finance, and artificial intelligence. Ultimately, it empowers scientists and engineers to tackle real-world challenges by combining rigorous mathematical reasoning with cutting-edge computational methods, leading to faster discoveries and more informed decision-making.",

Formally a mixture model corresponds to the mixture distribution that represents the probability distribution of observations in the overall population. However, while problems associated with \"mixture distributions\" relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations, \"mixture models\" are used to make statistical inferences about the properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled population, without sub-population identity information.\nMixture models should not be confused with models for compositional data, i.e., data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value (1, 100%, etc.). However, compositional models can be thought of as mixture models, where members of the population are sampled at random. Conversely, mixture models can be thought of as compositional models, where the total size reading population has been normalized to 1.",

    "ai_generated_text": "In statistics, a mixture model is a probabilistic model for representing the presence of subpopulations within an overall population, without requiring that an observed data point belongs unambiguously to a single subpopulation. Instead, mixture models assume that the data are generated from a combination of several underlying probability distributions, each corresponding to a latent group or component. The most common example is the Gaussian mixture model, where each component is a normal distribution with its own mean and variance, and the overall population is described as a weighted sum of these components. Such models are particularly useful in clustering, density estimation, and pattern recognition, where group membership is uncertain or overlapping. Parameters of mixture models are typically estimated using algorithms such as Expectation-Maximization (EM), which iteratively refines estimates of component distributions and their mixing proportions. Mixture models can handle complex data structures, including multimodal distributions, and are widely applied in fields like bioinformatics, market segmentation, and image analysis. They also allow for flexible modeling of heterogeneous data without forcing rigid classification boundaries. By capturing the underlying diversity in the data, mixture models provide a more nuanced understanding of the population than single-distribution approaches.",

Noise reduction algorithms may distort the signal to some degree. Noise rejection is the ability of a circuit to isolate an undesired signal component from the desired signal component, as with common-mode rejection ratio.\nAll signal processing devices, both analog and digital, have traits that make them susceptible to noise. Noise can be random with an even frequency distribution (white noise), or frequency-dependent noise introduced by a device's mechanism or signal processing algorithms.\nIn electronic systems, a major type of noise is hiss created by random electron motion due to thermal agitation. These agitated electrons rapidly add and subtract from the output signal and thus create detectable noise.\nIn the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger-sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more prone the medium is to noise. To compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to lower the noise to an acceptable level.",

Noise reduction algorithms may distort the signal to some extent, depending on how aggressively they are applied and the complexity of the noise profile. In audio processing, noise reduction can involve filtering out background hiss, hum, or other unwanted sounds using methods such as spectral subtraction, adaptive filtering, or machine learning–based enhancement. In image processing, noise reduction often targets random variations in pixel values caused by sensor imperfections, low light conditions, or compression artifacts. Techniques such as Gaussian smoothing, median filtering, and non-local means are commonly used, while more advanced approaches employ convolutional neural networks for denoising. A key challenge is balancing noise removal with preservation of important details; excessive reduction can blur edges, smear textures, or cause unnatural artifacts. Engineers often tailor algorithms to the type of noise and the intended application, whether it’s restoring archival audio recordings, improving speech intelligibility in telecommunications, or enhancing low-light photographs. Ultimately, noise reduction aims to improve clarity and quality without sacrificing the integrity of the original signal, requiring careful tuning and evaluation to achieve optimal results.",

The name comes from the translation of the German term for its operating mechanism, Staffelwalze, meaning \"stepped drum\".  It was the first calculator that could perform all four arithmetic operations.\nIts intricate precision gearwork, however, was somewhat beyond the fabrication technology of the time; mechanical problems, in addition to a design flaw in the carry mechanism, prevented the machines from working reliably.\nTwo prototypes were built; today only one survives in the National Library of Lower Saxony (Niedersächsische Landesbibliothek) in Hanover, Germany. Several later replicas are on display, such as the one at the Deutsches Museum, Munich. Despite the mechanical flaws of the stepped reckoner, it suggested possibilities to future calculator builders.

Unlike earlier devices, such as Pascal’s calculator, which could only perform addition and subtraction, the stepped reckoner was capable of multiplication and division through a system of repeated addition or subtraction using a cylindrical “stepped drum” mechanism. This innovative design allowed numbers to be entered via a movable carriage, enabling complex operations to be performed more efficiently. Leibniz’s machine demonstrated the potential for automating mathematical processes, paving the way for future developments in mechanical and, eventually, electronic computing. Although the stepped reckoner was not entirely free of mechanical flaws—it sometimes produced errors due to limitations in precision manufacturing at the time—it showcased the feasibility of programmable calculation. Its conceptual influence extended well beyond its physical existence, inspiring later inventors such as Charles Babbage in the 19th century. Today, the stepped reckoner is regarded as an important historical milestone, illustrating humanity’s enduring quest to reduce manual calculation effort and foreshadowing the principles behind modern computer architecture, where logical operations are executed through systematic, repeatable mechanical or electronic processes.",

A GGP agent must interpret these rules, reason about the game state, and develop strategies dynamically, often using search algorithms, logic inference, and sometimes machine learning techniques. The challenge lies in balancing computational efficiency with general reasoning, as the system must handle both perfect-information games and those involving uncertainty or hidden information.

It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior. The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:\nThe theory is often summarized as \"Cells that fire together wire together.\" However, Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to \"take part in firing\" cell B, and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B. This aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence.\nThe theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation.

Often summarized as “cells that fire together, wire together,” this principle describes how neural connections strengthen through simultaneous activation. In computational terms, Hebbian learning offers a simple yet powerful mechanism for adaptive systems, forming the basis of many unsupervised learning algorithms in artificial intelligence. When a presynaptic neuron consistently contributes to the firing of a postsynaptic neuron, the synapse between them undergoes long-term potentiation, enhancing its ability to transmit signals. This process is thought to be fundamental to the brain’s capacity for learning and memory formation. In artificial neural networks, Hebbian-like rules adjust weights between nodes based on correlation, allowing the system to detect patterns without explicit supervision. While biologically inspired, this approach lacks built-in mechanisms to prevent runaway excitation, so variations such as Oja’s rule introduce normalization to stabilize learning.

Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting.\nOne of the questions that arises in a decision tree algorithm is the optimal size of the final tree.  A tree that is too large risks overfitting the training data and poorly generalizing to new samples.  A small tree might not capture important structural information about the sample space.  However, it is hard to tell when a tree algorithm should stop because it is impossible to tell if the addition of a single extra node will dramatically decrease error.  This problem is known as the horizon effect.  A common strategy is to grow the tree until each node contains a small number of instances then use pruning to remove nodes that do not provide additional information.\nPruning should reduce the size of a learning tree without reducing predictive accuracy as measured by a cross-validation set.

It provides a structured, controlled vocabulary that describes genes in terms of their associated biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. By standardizing these descriptions, GO enables researchers to compare and integrate data from diverse organisms, enhancing cross-species analysis and functional genomics studies. The ontology is organized as a hierarchical graph, allowing terms to have multiple parent and child relationships, which aids in capturing the complexity of biological systems. GO annotations link specific genes or proteins to relevant ontology terms, often supported by experimental evidence or computational predictions. This framework is widely used in high-throughput experiments, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, to interpret large datasets and identify enriched biological functions. Continuous updates from the GO Consortium ensure that the ontology reflects current scientific knowledge, incorporating new discoveries and refining definitions. Tools like AmiGO and QuickGO allow easy browsing and searching of terms and annotations, while integration with other databases facilitates a richer understanding of biological networks. Overall, GO serves as a critical resource for computational biology, systems biology, and translational research, fostering interoperability and data-driven discoveries in life sciences.",

RBMs use an energy-based model where the joint probability of visible and hidden units is defined by an energy function, and learning involves adjusting weights to minimize the energy for observed data while increasing it for unobserved configurations. Training is commonly performed using contrastive divergence, an efficient approximation to maximum likelihood learning.

Early in his career, he published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine Oxford Poetry, before going on to publish travel writing, satire, and screenplays. He spent the latter part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death. By the end of his life, Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the foremost intellectuals of his time. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature nine times, and was elected Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature in 1962.[10]\nHuxley was a pacifist.[11] He grew interested in philosophical mysticism,[11][12][13] as well as universalism,[11][14] addressing these subjects with works such as The Perennial Philosophy (1945), which illustrates commonalities between Western and Eastern mysticism, and The Doors of Perception (1954), which interprets his own psychedelic experience with mescaline. In his most famous novel Brave New World (1932) and his final novel Island (1962), he presented his vision of dystopia and utopia, respectively.",

He wrote nearly 50 books, encompassing novels, non-fiction works, essays, and collections of poetry. Huxley is best remembered for his dystopian novel *Brave New World* (1932), which explored themes of technological control, societal conditioning, and the loss of individuality in a future dominated by consumerism and genetic engineering. His early works, such as *Crome Yellow*, reflected sharp social satire, while later writings, including *Island*, presented alternative visions of human potential. Beyond fiction, Huxley was deeply interested in science, mysticism, and consciousness, producing notable works like *The Doors of Perception*, where he examined his experiences with psychedelic substances as a means to expand awareness. His keen intellect and broad curiosity allowed him to engage with topics ranging from politics and religion to art and ecology, often blending scientific insight with philosophical reflection. Living through periods of great global upheaval, Huxley’s writings frequently warned against the misuse of technology and the dangers of totalitarianism. His influence endures, not only in literature but also in discussions of ethics, spirituality, and the future of human society, making him one of the most significant thinkers of the 20th century.",

An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized. The loss function could include terms from several levels of the hierarchy.\nIn statistics, typically a  loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century.  In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret.  In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cramér in the 1920s. In optimal control, the loss is the penalty for failing to achieve a desired value. In financial risk management, the function is mapped to a monetary loss.",

In supervised machine learning, loss functions are essential for training models, as they define the objective that the learning algorithm seeks to minimize. Common examples include mean squared error for regression problems and cross-entropy loss for classification tasks. In decision theory, a loss function can incorporate not only the difference between predicted and actual outcomes but also the consequences or risks associated with specific types of errors, enabling more informed decision-making under uncertainty. Choosing the right loss function is critical because it directly influences the behavior of the model, its convergence properties, and its ability to generalize. In practice, loss functions are often combined with regularization terms to prevent overfitting and to balance model complexity with predictive accuracy, ensuring robust performance on unseen data.",

Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.\nData mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on statistical modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information. In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on the application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.\nData integration is a precursor to data analysis, and data analysis is closely linked to data visualization and data dissemination.",

In contrast to pattern recognition, the match usually has to be exact: \"either it will or will not be a  match.\"  The patterns generally have the form of either sequences or tree structures. Uses of pattern matching include outputting the locations (if any) of a pattern within a token sequence, to output some component of the matched pattern, and to substitute the matching pattern with some other token sequence (i.e., search and replace).\nSequence patterns (e.g., a text string) are often described using regular expressions and matched using techniques such as backtracking.\nTree patterns are used in some programming languages as a general tool to process data based on its structure, e.g. C#, F#, Haskell, ML, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift and the symbolic mathematics language Mathematica have special syntax for expressing tree patterns and a language construct for conditional execution and value retrieval based on it.\nOften it is possible to give alternative patterns that are tried one by one, which yields a powerful conditional programming construct.

In contrast to pattern recognition, which often involves probabilistic or statistical methods to identify patterns in noisy or incomplete data, pattern matching typically refers to a precise and deterministic process, where the sequence and structure must align exactly or according to well-defined rules. This concept is widely applied in areas such as text processing, programming language compilers, network intrusion detection, and data validation. For example, regular expressions are a common tool for pattern matching in strings, enabling developers to search, extract, and manipulate text efficiently. In functional programming languages, pattern matching plays a central role in simplifying conditional logic, allowing developers to concisely deconstruct data structures and branch execution based on their shape or content. Moreover, pattern matching can be optimized using algorithms such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt or Boyer-Moore string search methods, which reduce the time complexity by avoiding unnecessary comparisons. Understanding pattern matching is essential for designing efficient search algorithms, parsing structured data, and implementing systems that respond predictably to specific input configurations, making it a fundamental skill for software engineers and computer scientists alike.",

Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy and cost of further rework. Similarly to monetary debt, technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g. as a proof-of-concept) is required to move projects forward. On the other hand, some experts claim that the \"technical debt\" metaphor tends to minimize the ramifications, which results in insufficient prioritization of the necessary work to correct it.\nAs a change is started on a codebase, there is often the need to make other coordinated changes in other parts of the codebase or documentation.

Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.\nEvolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.",

    "ai_generated_text": "A sigmoid function is a mathematical function having a characteristic \"S\"-shaped curve or sigmoid curve. A common example of a sigmoid function is the logistic function, which is widely used in statistics, machine learning, and artificial neural networks. The general form of the logistic function is \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\), where \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm. This function maps any real-valued input to a value between 0 and 1, making it particularly useful for modeling probabilities and binary classification problems. In neural networks, sigmoid activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to capture complex relationships in data. However, in deep learning, sigmoid functions can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become very small for large positive or negative inputs, slowing down training. Despite this drawback, they remain valuable in certain contexts, such as output layers for binary classification. Sigmoid functions also appear in biological systems, economics, and population growth models, where they describe processes that saturate over time. Their smooth, continuous curve makes them ideal for representing transitions between two states, and their mathematical simplicity enables efficient computation in software implementations.",

Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at neural dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or activation, representing a neuron's action potential which is transmitted along its axon). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function[clarification needed]. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often  monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded. Non-monotonic, unbounded and oscillating activation functions with multiple zeros that outperform sigmoidal and ReLU like activation functions on many tasks have also been recently explored. The thresholding function has inspired building logic gates referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times.\nThe artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear system's transfer function.\nArtificial neurons can also refer to artificial cells in neuromorphic engineering (see below) that are similar to natural physical neurons.",

It uses formal models like Turing machines, finite automata, and lambda calculus to represent computation in a precise mathematical way. By analyzing these models, researchers determine the resources required for problem-solving, including time, space, and randomness, and identify inherent limitations. The theory of computation also investigates the relationships between different complexity classes, reductions between problems, and the boundaries between feasible and infeasible computation. This knowledge is foundational for designing efficient algorithms, understanding cryptographic security, and guiding the development of programming languages. Furthermore, it has deep philosophical implications, touching on the nature of intelligence, the possibility of artificial general intelligence, and the limits of human reasoning. Ultimately, the theory of computation provides both the practical tools and the conceptual insights necessary to understand the essence of algorithms and the fundamental capabilities of any computing device.",

The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures. The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.\nSocial networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and \"web of group affiliations\". Jacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to study interpersonal relationships. These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s and theories and methods of social networks became pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences by the 1980s.

After a function's value is computed for that parameter or set of parameters, the result is stored in a lookup table that is indexed by the values of those parameters; the next time the function is called, the table is consulted to determine whether the result for that combination of parameter values is already available. If so, the stored result is simply returned. If not, the function is evaluated and another entry is added to the lookup table for reuse.\nLazy evaluation is difficult to combine with imperative features such as exception handling and input/output, because the order of operations becomes indeterminate. \nThe opposite of lazy evaluation is eager evaluation, sometimes known as strict evaluation.

This approach avoids unnecessary calculations, potentially improving performance and allowing the creation of infinite data structures, since values are computed only when they are accessed. Lazy evaluation is closely associated with functional programming languages such as Haskell, where it plays a central role in enabling concise and expressive code. By deferring computation, programs can represent sequences, streams, or other potentially unbounded collections without consuming memory for unused elements. Internally, lazy evaluation often relies on mechanisms like thunks—data structures that store an unevaluated expression along with the environment needed to compute it. When the program eventually needs the value, the thunk is evaluated and replaced with the computed result, ensuring that subsequent accesses do not trigger recomputation. This strategy can also help with avoiding runtime errors by not evaluating expressions that might otherwise cause exceptions if their results are never used. However, lazy evaluation may introduce complexity in debugging and reasoning about performance, since the timing of computation is determined by demand rather than explicit program order.

Synchronous update schemes change all variables simultaneously, while asynchronous updates alter one or a subset of variables at a time, potentially leading to different dynamics.

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.\nComputer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.\nThe scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multi-dimensional data from a 3D scanner, or medical scanning devices. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.\nSub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, 3D scene modeling, and image restoration.",

From the perspective of engineering, it involves designing algorithms and systems that can process, analyze, and interpret visual data in a way that mimics human perception. Engineers working in computer vision integrate knowledge from image processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, optics, and hardware design to create solutions for real-world applications. These may include object detection, facial recognition, autonomous navigation, medical imaging analysis, and industrial quality control. The engineering process often starts with data acquisition using cameras or sensors, followed by preprocessing to enhance image quality and reduce noise. Then, sophisticated models—often based on deep learning—are applied to extract meaningful features and make predictions or decisions. Challenges in this field include dealing with variations in lighting, viewpoint, occlusion, and scale, as well as ensuring computational efficiency for real-time processing. Moreover, engineers must consider ethical and privacy implications, especially in surveillance and biometric systems. As hardware becomes faster and algorithms more advanced, computer vision is increasingly integrated into everyday devices, enabling smarter, more interactive technologies that can interpret and respond to the visual world with growing accuracy and reliability.",

These traits can either be demographic with a focus on race, economic status, sex, age, generation, level of education, income level, and employment, or psychographic focused on the consumer values, personality, attitude, opinion, lifestyle and interest. This focus can also entail behavioral variables, such as browser history, purchase history, and other recent online activities. The process of algorithm targeting eliminates waste.\nTraditional forms of advertising, including billboards, newspapers, magazines, and radio channels, are progressively becoming replaced by online advertisements. The Information and communication technology (ICT) space has transformed recently, resulting in targeted advertising stretching across all ICT technologies, such as web, IPTV, and mobile environments. In the next generation's advertising, the importance of targeted advertisements will radically increase, as it spreads across numerous ICT channels cohesively.\nThrough the emergence of new online channels, the usefulness of targeted advertising is increasing because companies aim to minimize wasted advertising by means of information technology. Most targeted new media advertising currently uses second-order proxies for targets, such as tracking online or mobile web activities of consumers, associating historical web page consumer demographics with new consumer web page access, using a search word as the basis of implied interest, or contextual advertising.",

This method relies heavily on data collection, such as browsing history, search queries, location data, and demographic information, to identify potential customers who are more likely to respond to specific messages. Companies use algorithms and analytics tools to segment audiences and deliver personalized content, increasing the relevance of ads and improving conversion rates. For example, a sports equipment retailer might target ads to individuals who frequently visit fitness-related websites or follow athletic influencers on social media. While targeted advertising can be highly effective, it also raises privacy concerns, as it often involves tracking users’ online behavior across multiple platforms. Regulatory measures like GDPR and CCPA aim to give consumers more control over their personal data, requiring transparency and consent for data collection. In the modern digital economy, targeted advertising has become a dominant strategy because it optimizes marketing budgets and enhances user engagement. However, its ethical use depends on balancing business objectives with respect for user privacy and ensuring that data-driven practices remain transparent and secure. \n\nWould you like me to also write a **technical explanation** of how targeted advertising works behind the scenes?",

Unlike \"fair dealing\" rights that exist in most countries with a British legal history, the fair use right is a general exception that applies to all different kinds of uses with all types of works and turns on a flexible proportionality test that examines the purpose of the use, the amount used, and the impact on the market of the original work.\nThe doctrine of \"fair use\" originated in the Anglo-American common law during the 18th and 19th centuries as a way of preventing copyright law from being too rigidly applied and \"stifling the very creativity which [copyright] law is designed to foster.\" Though originally a common law doctrine, it was enshrined in statutory law when the U.S. Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1976.

For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.: 587–588  Random forests generally outperform decision trees, but their accuracy is lower than gradient boosted trees.[citation needed] However, data characteristics can affect their performance.\nThe first algorithm for random decision forests was created in 1995 by Tin Kam Ho using the random subspace method, which, in Ho's formulation, is a way to implement the \"stochastic discrimination\" approach to classification proposed by Eugene Kleinberg.\nAn extension of the algorithm was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler,[10] who registered[11] \"Random Forests\" as a trademark in 2006 (as of 2019[update], owned by Minitab, Inc.).[12] The extension combines Breiman's \"bagging\" idea and random selection of features, introduced first by Ho and later independently by Amit and Geman[13] in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variance.\nRandom forests are frequently used as \"blackbox\" models in businesses, as they generate reasonable predictions across a wide range of data while requiring little configuration.[citation needed]",

Each tree is built using a random subset of the training data and, at each split, a random subset of features. This randomness helps ensure that the individual trees are de-correlated, which reduces the risk of overfitting and improves generalization performance. The final prediction is obtained by aggregating the outputs of all the trees—commonly via majority voting for classification tasks or averaging for regression tasks. One of the key strengths of random forests is their ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensionality, as well as their robustness to noisy data and outliers. They can also provide estimates of feature importance, which is useful for understanding which variables contribute most to the prediction. While random forests are generally less interpretable than a single decision tree, they often deliver better predictive accuracy. However, they can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with a very large number of trees or features. Despite this, their versatility and strong performance have made them a popular choice in fields ranging from bioinformatics to finance.",

For example, in the factoring problem, the instances are the integers n, and solutions are prime numbers p that are the nontrivial prime factors of n.\nComputational problems are one of the main objects of study in theoretical computer science. The field of computational complexity theory attempts to determine the amount of resources (computational complexity) solving a given problem will require and explain why some problems are intractable or undecidable. Computational problems belong to complexity classes that define broadly the resources (e.g. time, space/memory, energy, circuit depth) it takes to compute (solve) them with various abstract machines. For example, the complexity class P for classical machines, and BQP for quantum machines.\nIt is typical of many problems to represent both instances and solutions by binary strings, namely elements of {0, 1}*.[a] For example, numbers can be represented as binary strings using binary encoding.",

Computational problems are often classified according to their complexity, using models such as the Turing machine and complexity classes like P, NP, and beyond. The study of these problems involves determining whether they can be solved efficiently, and if so, developing algorithms that do so.

Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.\nEvolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.",

The fitness of each candidate is evaluated according to a problem-specific objective function, and those with higher fitness are more likely to be selected for reproduction. Over time, this iterative search process tends to yield increasingly optimal solutions, even for complex, nonlinear, or high-dimensional problems where traditional gradient-based methods may fail. Variants of EAs include genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolution strategies, and differential evolution, each with distinct representations and variation operators. One of the strengths of EAs is their flexibility—they can be applied to optimization problems with discrete, continuous, or mixed variables, and they can incorporate constraints or multiple objectives. However, they can be computationally expensive and require careful parameter tuning, such as population size, mutation rate, and selection pressure, to balance exploration and exploitation. In modern applications, EAs are often hybridized with other machine learning or optimization techniques to improve convergence speed and solution quality.",

This approach allows the learned rules to be interpretable and verifiable, making ILP particularly valuable in domains where transparency and explainability are critical, such as bioinformatics, natural language processing, and legal reasoning. ILP systems operate by searching the hypothesis space, guided by constraints derived from the background knowledge, to find the most compact and accurate logical theory that explains the given data. Unlike purely statistical methods, ILP maintains a symbolic framework, ensuring that the resulting models can be integrated with other logical reasoning systems. Advances in ILP have focused on improving scalability, handling noisy or incomplete data, and integrating with probabilistic reasoning to better manage uncertainty.

DSP applications include audio and speech processing, sonar, radar and other sensor array processing, spectral density estimation, statistical signal processing, digital image processing, data compression, video coding, audio coding, image compression, signal processing for telecommunications, control systems, biomedical engineering, and seismology, among others.\nDSP can involve linear or nonlinear operations. Nonlinear signal processing is closely related to nonlinear system identification and can be implemented in the time, frequency, and spatio-temporal domains.\nThe application of digital computation to signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as error detection and correction in transmission as well as data compression. Digital signal processing is also fundamental to digital technology, such as digital telecommunication and wireless communications. DSP is applicable to both streaming data and static (stored) data.",

    "ai_generated_text": "Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of operations on signals in order to analyze, modify, or optimize them for specific applications. In DSP, signals—such as audio, video, temperature readings, or sensor outputs—are first converted from their analog form into digital data through sampling and quantization. Once in digital form, mathematical algorithms can be applied to filter noise, compress data, detect patterns, or enhance certain features. Common techniques include Fourier transforms for frequency analysis, convolution for filtering, and statistical methods for predictive modeling. DSP is widely used in telecommunications for encoding and decoding signals, in audio engineering for equalization and effects, and in medical devices for processing imaging data such as MRI or ultrasound scans. The advantage of DSP over analog processing lies in its flexibility, precision, and reproducibility; changes can be implemented through software without altering physical hardware. Furthermore, advances in processor speed and power efficiency have enabled real-time DSP applications in mobile devices, embedded systems, and industrial equipment. As technology continues to evolve, DSP plays an increasingly critical role in enabling smarter, faster, and more efficient digital systems across industries.",

It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances.

Common algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. SL can be applied to both classification tasks, where outputs are discrete categories, and regression tasks, where outputs are continuous values. Key challenges in supervised learning include overfitting, where the model memorizes training data rather than generalizing, and underfitting, where it fails to capture important trends.

DBNs were developed by Paul Dagum in the early 1990s at Stanford University's Section on Medical Informatics. Dagum developed DBNs to unify and extend traditional linear state-space models such as Kalman filters, linear and normal forecasting models such as ARMA and simple dependency models such as hidden Markov models into a general probabilistic representation and inference mechanism for arbitrary nonlinear and non-normal time-dependent domains.\nToday, DBNs are common in robotics, and have shown potential for a wide range of data mining applications.  For example, they have been used in speech recognition, digital forensics, protein sequencing, and bioinformatics.

DBNs are particularly useful for representing and reasoning about sequential data, such as speech signals, stock market trends, or sensor readings in robotics. They consist of two main components: an *intra-slice* structure that defines the probabilistic relationships among variables within the same time step, and an *inter-slice* structure that specifies dependencies between variables across consecutive time steps. By unrolling the network over multiple time steps, DBNs can capture complex temporal patterns and propagate uncertainty over time. Inference in DBNs can be performed using algorithms such as forward-backward, particle filtering, or variational methods, depending on whether the model is discrete or continuous. Learning the parameters and structure of a DBN from data often involves techniques like Expectation-Maximization (EM).

He was a mathematics professor at the University of Jena, and is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language, logic, and mathematics. Though he was largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), and, to some extent, Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) introduced his work to later generations of philosophers. Frege is widely considered to be the greatest logician since Aristotle, and one of the most profound philosophers of mathematics ever.[16]\nHis contributions include the development of modern logic in the Begriffsschrift and work in the foundations of mathematics. His book the Foundations of Arithmetic is the seminal text of the logicist project, and is cited by Michael Dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn. His philosophical papers \"On Sense and Reference\" and \"The Thought\" are also widely cited. The former argues for two different types of meaning and descriptivism.

Born in 1848, Frege made groundbreaking contributions to the formalization of logic, notably through his invention of the *Begriffsschrift* (“concept script”), a formal system designed to represent logical relationships with precision. His distinction between sense (*Sinn*) and reference (*Bedeutung*) became a cornerstone of semantics, influencing thinkers from Bertrand Russell to Ludwig Wittgenstein. Frege’s rigorous approach to the philosophy of language anticipated the development of predicate logic, surpassing Aristotelian syllogistics in expressive power. Despite his intellectual achievements, recognition during his lifetime was limited, and much of his influence only emerged posthumously when later philosophers rediscovered his work. His ideas underpin the logical structure of mathematics, computer science, and linguistic theory, and his formalism remains integral to modern predicate calculus. In computing, Frege’s emphasis on precise symbolic representation resonates with programming language design and formal verification methods, ensuring logical consistency in complex systems. Today, Frege is celebrated not only as a central figure in mathematical logic but also as a thinker whose insights continue to shape the intersection of language, thought, and computation.\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to also include a brief timeline of Frege’s major works and their impact on computer science?",

It is a formal theory for handling image structures at different scales, by representing an image as a one-parameter family of smoothed images, the scale-space representation, parametrized by the size of the smoothing kernel used for suppressing fine-scale structures. The parameter \n\n\n\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t}\n\n in this family is referred to as the scale parameter, with the interpretation that image structures of spatial size smaller than about \n\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {t}}}\n\n have largely been smoothed away in the scale-space level at scale \n\n\n\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t}\n\n.\nThe main type of scale space is the linear (Gaussian) scale space, which has wide applicability as well as the attractive property of being possible to derive from a small set of scale-space axioms.  The corresponding scale-space framework encompasses a theory for Gaussian derivative operators, which can be used as a basis for expressing a large class of visual operations for computerized systems that process visual information.  This framework also allows visual operations to be made scale invariant, which is necessary for dealing with the size variations that may occur in image data, because real-world objects may be of different sizes and in addition the distance between the object and the camera may be unknown and may vary depending on the circumstances.[10]",

    "ai_generated_text": "Scale-space theory is a framework for multi-scale signal representation developed by the computer vision, image processing and signal processing communities with complementary motivations from physics. It provides a mathematical approach for representing a signal, image, or dataset at multiple levels of resolution, allowing analysis that is robust to noise and small-scale variations. The core idea is to embed the original signal into a one-parameter family of gradually smoothed versions, typically generated by convolution with Gaussian kernels of increasing standard deviation. This creates a continuous scale parameter that controls the level of detail, enabling feature detection and analysis at the most appropriate scale for the task. In computer vision, scale-space theory underlies algorithms for edge detection, blob detection, and corner detection, ensuring that features are identified consistently even when objects appear at different sizes or viewing distances. From a physics perspective, the Gaussian smoothing process relates to heat diffusion, providing a natural justification for its use. In signal processing, scale-space methods help in analyzing frequency content without introducing artifacts caused by abrupt filtering. Overall, scale-space theory offers a principled foundation for handling multi-scale phenomena in both one-dimensional and multidimensional data, making it an essential tool in modern computational analysis and pattern recognition.",

    "original_text": "In the philosophy of logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called modus ponens takes two premises, one in the form \"If p then q\" and another in the form \"p\", and returns the conclusion \"q\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.\nTypically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary ω-rule.\nPopular rules of inference in propositional logic include modus ponens, modus tollens, and contraposition. First-order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers.",

Common examples include modus ponens, modus tollens, and hypothetical syllogism, each of which prescribes a specific way to derive valid conclusions from given statements. In formal logic systems, inference rules are typically expressed in symbolic notation, making them precise and unambiguous. They are essential in mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, where proofs, algorithms, and automated reasoning depend upon them. The correctness of an inference rule is defined by its soundness—if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true—and its completeness, meaning all logically valid conclusions can be derived using the available rules. In computational contexts, inference rules can be implemented as algorithms, enabling machines to perform logical deductions at scale. Understanding and applying inference rules is central to constructing valid arguments, verifying proofs, and ensuring that logical systems function reliably and predictably.",

The resulting ensemble of the loom and Jacquard machine is then called a Jacquard loom. The machine was patented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804, based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), and Jacques Vaucanson (1740). The machine was controlled by a \"chain of cards\"; a number of punched cards laced together into a continuous sequence. Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. \nBoth the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving innovations as Jacquard shedding made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of complex pattern weaving. The term \"Jacquard\" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning.

The machine uses a series of punched cards to dictate the movement of each warp thread, essentially encoding the pattern. This concept of programmable control was a precursor to modern computing, as the punched card system later influenced early data processing machines and computers. By automating the selection of threads, the Jacquard mechanism reduced the need for highly skilled manual labor, lowered production costs, and expanded the possibilities of textile design. Its adoption spread rapidly across Europe and beyond, contributing to industrial growth during the 19th century. Today, the principles of the Jacquard machine are still found in modern computer-controlled looms, demonstrating its lasting impact on both manufacturing and technology.

In two dimensions, the active shape model represents a discrete version of this approach, taking advantage of the point distribution model to restrict the shape range to an explicit domain learnt from a training set.\nSnakes do not solve the entire problem of finding contours in images, since the method requires knowledge of the desired contour shape beforehand.

Optimization is achieved through iterative numerical methods, allowing the contour to deform and converge to the target shape.

The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another.\nCircuits can be constructed of discrete components connected by individual pieces of wire, but today it is much more common to create interconnections by photolithographic techniques on a laminated substrate (a printed circuit board or PCB) and solder the components to these interconnections to create a finished circuit. In an integrated circuit or IC, the components and interconnections are formed on the same substrate, typically a semiconductor such as doped silicon or (less commonly) gallium arsenide.\nAn electronic circuit can usually be categorized as an analog circuit, a digital circuit, or a mixed-signal circuit (a combination of analog circuits and digital circuits).

In analog circuits, precise component values are critical to ensure correct frequency response or voltage levels, while in digital circuits, timing and logic design play a key role in reliable operation. Modern electronic circuits often integrate many components into a single semiconductor package, known as an integrated circuit (IC), which can contain millions or even billions of microscopic transistors. Designing a circuit involves selecting appropriate components, creating a schematic diagram, and then translating it into a physical layout, ensuring proper connections and minimizing noise or interference.

Typically, these results concern the approximation capabilities of the feedforward architecture on the space of continuous functions between two Euclidean spaces, and the approximation is with respect to the compact convergence topology.\nHowever, there are also a variety of results between non-Euclidean spaces and other commonly used architectures and, more generally, algorithmically generated sets of functions, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, radial basis-functions, or neural networks with specific properties. Most universal approximation theorems can be parsed into two classes. The first quantifies the approximation capabilities of neural networks with an arbitrary number of artificial neurons (\"arbitrary width\" case) and the second focuses on the case with an arbitrary number of hidden layers, each containing a limited number of artificial neurons (\"arbitrary depth\" case). In addition to these two classes, there are also universal approximation theorems for neural networks with bounded number of hidden layers and a limited number of neurons in each layer (\"bounded depth and bounded width\" case).\nUniversal approximation theorems imply that neural networks can represent a wide variety of interesting functions when given appropriate weights.

Any specified subset of the sample space is called an event.\nCentral subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes (which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion).\nAlthough it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.\nAs a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of data.

Since spikes are transmitted along the axon and synapses from the sending neuron to many other neurons, spiking neurons are considered to be a major information processing unit of the nervous system. Spiking neuron models can be divided into different categories:  the most detailed mathematical models are biophysical neuron models (also called Hodgkin-Huxley models) that describe the membrane voltage as a function of the input current and the activation of ion channels. Mathematically simpler are integrate-and-fire models that describe the membrane voltage as a function of the input current and predict the spike times without a description of the biophysical processes that shape the time course of an action potential.

In many machine learning problems, the data to be learned do not cover the entire input space. For example, a facial recognition system may not need to classify any possible image, but only the subset of images that contain faces. The technique of manifold learning assumes that the relevant subset of data comes from a manifold, a mathematical structure with useful properties. The technique also assumes that the function to be learned is smooth: data with different labels are not likely to be close together, and so the labeling function should not change quickly in areas where there are likely to be many data points. Because of this assumption, a manifold regularization algorithm can use unlabeled data to inform where the learned function is allowed to change quickly and where it is not, using an extension of the technique of Tikhonov regularization. Manifold regularization algorithms can extend supervised learning algorithms in semi-supervised learning and transductive learning settings, where unlabeled data are available.

The core idea is that high-dimensional data often lies on or near a lower-dimensional manifold embedded in the input space. By exploiting this geometric structure, manifold regularization improves generalization, especially when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data is plentiful. It does so by introducing an additional term in the learning objective that penalizes functions varying too rapidly along the manifold, encouraging smoothness with respect to the intrinsic data geometry. This is often achieved by constructing a graph from both labeled and unlabeled samples, estimating the manifold using local neighborhood relationships, and incorporating the graph Laplacian into the regularization term. As a result, the learned function respects both the labeled examples and the overall distribution of the data, effectively bridging supervised and semi-supervised learning. Manifold regularization has been applied in domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics, where data is complex but has underlying structure. Its strength lies in leveraging unlabeled data more effectively, reducing overfitting, and adhering to the assumption that points close on the manifold should also have similar outputs.",

These methods allow robots to improve their performance over time, handle uncertainty, and operate in unstructured environments without exhaustive manual programming. For example, a robot equipped with vision-based learning can recognize objects it has never seen before by relating them to previously learned features, while a manipulation robot might refine its grasping strategies through trial and error.

Conditional independence is usually formulated in terms of random variables and their joint distributions, specifically through the notation \\( X \\perp Y \\mid Z \\), which reads “X is independent of Y given Z.” This means that once we know the value of Z, learning the value of Y provides no additional information about X, and vice versa. Such relationships are fundamental in graphical models like Bayesian networks, where the conditional independence assumptions significantly reduce the complexity of computations. For example, in a medical diagnosis model, once the presence or absence of a certain disease is known, some symptoms may no longer provide extra diagnostic value. Mathematically, conditional independence can be expressed as \\( P(X, Y \\mid Z) = P(X \\mid Z) P(Y \\mid Z) \\), which allows factorization of joint probability distributions. This property not only simplifies inference but also guides model design, enabling efficient algorithms for reasoning under uncertainty.

Also known as Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, it is a method of regularization of ill-posed problems.[a] It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias–variance tradeoff).\nThe theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their Technometrics papers “RIDGE regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems” and “RIDGE regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems”. This was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysis.\nRidge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables—by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.",

It has been used extensively to address the problem of multicollinearity, which can cause ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates to become unstable and have high variance. By introducing a regularization term—specifically, the squared magnitude of the coefficients multiplied by a tuning parameter λ—ridge regression shrinks the coefficients toward zero without making them exactly zero. This penalization reduces variance at the cost of introducing a small bias, often resulting in improved predictive accuracy for new data. Unlike OLS, ridge regression can handle datasets where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations, making it valuable in high-dimensional statistical modeling and machine learning contexts. The choice of λ is critical and is typically determined through cross-validation to balance bias and variance optimally. Applications include economics, genomics, image analysis, and any domain where correlated predictors are common. While ridge regression does not perform variable selection like Lasso regression, it retains all predictors, which can be advantageous when domain knowledge suggests that all variables contribute meaningfully to the outcome, even if their individual coefficients are small.",

This flexibility makes it useful in applications like washing machines, air conditioners, robotics, and complex decision-making systems.

Color information is often captured using a color filter array, such as the Bayer filter, which separates incoming light into red, green, and blue components. The raw data from the sensor must then undergo image signal processing, including demosaicing, noise reduction, and color correction, to produce the final viewable image. Advances in sensor technology continue to improve resolution, dynamic range, and low-light performance.",

GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.\nModern GPUs are efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. Their parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. In some CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.\nIn the 1970s, the term \"GPU\" originally stood for graphics processor unit and described a programmable processing unit independently working from the CPU and responsible for graphics manipulation and output. Later, in 1994, Sony used the term (now standing for graphics processing unit) in reference to the PlayStation console's Toshiba-designed Sony GPU in 1994. The term was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as \"the world's first GPU\". It was presented as a \"single-chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines\". Rival ATI Technologies coined the term \"visual processing unit\" or VPU with the release of the Radeon 9700 in 2002.",

Originally developed to handle complex rendering tasks in video games, GPUs have evolved into powerful parallel processors capable of handling a wide range of computational workloads. Modern GPUs consist of thousands of smaller cores that can execute many operations simultaneously, making them ideal for tasks that require massive parallelism, such as 3D rendering, image processing, and machine learning. Unlike central processing units (CPUs), which are optimized for sequential task execution, GPUs excel at performing repetitive calculations across large datasets. This capability has led to their widespread adoption in fields such as artificial intelligence, scientific simulations, and cryptocurrency mining. The architecture of a GPU allows for efficient handling of vector and matrix operations, which are fundamental to graphics and deep learning algorithms. Additionally, GPUs work in conjunction with specialized APIs like OpenGL, DirectX, and CUDA to provide developers with tools for harnessing their computational power. As technology advances, GPUs continue to play a critical role in both consumer electronics and high-performance computing applications, driving innovation in visualization and data-intensive processing.",

These systems are widely used in domains such as e-commerce, streaming services, social media, and online advertising to improve user engagement and satisfaction. They operate by analyzing large datasets containing user preferences, behavior patterns, and item attributes, employing techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches. Collaborative filtering leverages the similarities between users or items based on past interactions, while content-based filtering focuses on the attributes of items that match a user's profile. Hybrid methods combine both to overcome limitations such as the cold start problem, where insufficient data about new users or items exists. Modern recommender systems often integrate machine learning algorithms, deep learning architectures, and contextual information to enhance accuracy and personalization. They may also incorporate implicit feedback, such as click-through rates or time spent, alongside explicit ratings. As personalization becomes increasingly important in digital experiences, recommender systems play a crucial role in guiding users through vast amounts of information, thereby optimizing decision-making and increasing overall platform efficiency.",

The prediction model can have varying levels of sophistication and accuracy, ranging from a crude heuristic to the use of complex predictive analytics techniques.\nCustomer lifetime value can also be defined as the monetary value of a customer relationship, based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the customer relationship. Customer lifetime value is an important concept in that it encourages firms to shift their focus from quarterly profits to the long-term health of their customer relationships. Customer lifetime value is an important metric because it represents an upper limit on spending to acquire new customers. For this reason it is an important element in calculating payback of advertising spent in marketing mix modeling.\nOne of the first accounts of the term customer lifetime value is in the 1988 book Database Marketing, which includes detailed worked examples.

It helps companies understand the long-term worth of their customers beyond individual transactions, enabling more informed decisions about customer acquisition costs, retention strategies, and resource allocation. By analyzing purchase frequency, average order value, and customer longevity, businesses can segment their audience and tailor marketing efforts to maximize profitability. A high CLV indicates that a customer consistently provides substantial value, justifying higher investments in personalized campaigns, loyalty programs, and premium support. Conversely, a low CLV may signal the need for improved engagement or product offerings. Modern analytics platforms often integrate CLV calculations with predictive modeling, allowing marketers to forecast future revenue streams and adjust strategies proactively. Understanding and optimizing CLV is especially important in competitive industries where acquiring new customers can be expensive. When leveraged effectively, CLV not only enhances profitability but also strengthens customer relationships by aligning business priorities with long-term satisfaction and trust, ultimately driving sustainable growth and brand loyalty.",

    "original_text": "Optimal control theory is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with finding a control for a dynamical system over a period of time such that an objective function is optimized. It has numerous applications in science, engineering and operations research. For example, the dynamical system might be a spacecraft with controls corresponding to rocket thrusters, and the objective might be to reach the moon with minimum fuel expenditure. Or the dynamical system could be a nation's economy, with the objective to minimize unemployment; the controls in this case could be fiscal and monetary policy. A dynamical system may also be introduced to embed operations research problems within the framework of optimal control theory.\nOptimal control is an extension of the calculus of variations, and is a mathematical optimization method for deriving control policies. The method is largely due to the work of Lev Pontryagin and Richard Bellman in the 1950s, after contributions to calculus of variations by Edward J. McShane. Optimal control can be seen as a control strategy in control theory.",

It extends the calculus of variations by incorporating system dynamics, control inputs, and state constraints, making it a powerful tool in engineering, economics, robotics, and many scientific fields. In optimal control problems, the system’s behavior is typically described by differential equations, and the control variables influence the evolution of the system’s state. The objective function often represents a cost, energy consumption, deviation from a desired trajectory, or profit, depending on the application. Solutions may be derived using analytical methods, such as Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle or the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, or numerical techniques like direct collocation and shooting methods. Optimal control enables the design of strategies that ensure efficiency, stability, and robustness, even in complex, nonlinear, or uncertain environments. For instance, it can optimize fuel usage in spacecraft trajectories, regulate industrial processes for maximum yield, or coordinate autonomous vehicles for safe and efficient movement. By systematically balancing competing goals and constraints, optimal control theory provides a rigorous framework for informed decision-making in dynamic systems.",

Instead of directly observing the underlying state of the system, we only observe outputs (emissions) that are probabilistically related to those states. An HMM is characterized by a set of possible states, a transition probability matrix describing the likelihood of moving from one state to another, an emission probability distribution for each state, and an initial state distribution. The “hidden” nature of the states means that inference techniques, such as the Forward-Backward algorithm or the Viterbi algorithm, are used to determine the most probable sequence of states given a series of observations. HMMs are widely used in temporal pattern recognition applications such as speech recognition, handwriting recognition, bioinformatics (e.g., gene prediction), and financial modeling.
